"Today in class, I found that linear indexing was extremely interesting because of how you can count the place that you want to represent in your code. I found it interesting because of how easy and conceptual the concept is. I feel that it is an easier concept to grasp and it makes a lot of sense in my head rather than the other few kinds of indexing. I also thought that it was the most logical way of indexing as well.
