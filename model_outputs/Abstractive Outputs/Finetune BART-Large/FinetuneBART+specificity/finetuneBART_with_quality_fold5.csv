Students enjoyed the in-class demonstrations as it helped them further deepen their understanding of the concepts. Along with that, they also enjoyed the practice problems and examples."
There seems to be no confusion related to the material covered in class. Students really enjoyed the live demonstrations in class. They especially liked watching the objects race down the hill as it helped them deepen their understanding of several physics concepts.,"There seems to be no confusion related to the material covered in class. Students enjoyed the in-class demonstrations as it helped them further deepen their understanding of inertia. Along with that, they also enjoyed working with live models."
There is a lot of confusion related to the material covered in class. Students don't have a clear understanding of the difference between types of acceleration. Along with that there is also confusion related to rotational kinematics. I would suggest going over these at the beginning of next class.,"There is a lot of confusion related to the material covered in class. Students would like more clarity related to acceleration, rotational kinematics, and inertia. I would suggest going over these topics at the beginning of next class."
"There is a lot of confusion related to the material covered in class. Students would like more clarity related to the rocket problem, types of collisions, and the bullet problem. I would suggest going over these at the beginning of next class.","There is a lot of confusion related to the problems covered in class. Students would like more clarity related to collisions, rockets, and the bullet problem. I would suggest going over these topics at the beginning of next class."
"There seems to be a lot of confusion related to the material covered in class. Students would like more clarity related to the power problem, graph problems, and potential energy problems. I would suggest going over these at the beginning of next lecture.","There is a lot of confusion related to the problems covered in class. Students would like more clarity related to potential energy, graphs, and the power problem. I would suggest going over these topics at the beginning of next class."
There is a lot of confusion related to the material covered in class. Students would like more clarity over the in-class problems and examples. Along with that there is also a lack of understanding over reflection and refraction. Students would also like a proper Trig Review before doing these problems.,"There is a lot of confusion related to the material covered in class. Students would like more clarity related to refraction, reflections, and trigonometry. I would suggest going over these topics at the beginning of next class."
