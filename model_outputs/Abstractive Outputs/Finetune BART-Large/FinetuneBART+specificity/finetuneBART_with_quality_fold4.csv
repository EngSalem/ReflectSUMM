There seems to be no confusion related to the material covered in class. Students really enjoyed the demonstrations shown in class especially the ones related to simple harmonic motion and stress. One student enjoyed the modulus problem.,"There seems to be no confusion related to the material covered in class. Students really enjoyed the in-class examples as it helped them deepen their understanding of concepts such as stress and harmonic motion. Along with that, they also enjoyed learning about the different types of pressures on objects."
"There is a lot of confusion related to the material covered in class. Students would like more clarity over inertia, angular momentum, and the in-class problems. I would suggest going over these at the beginning of next class.","There is a lot of confusion related to the material covered in class. Students would like more clarity related to angular momentum, moment of inertia, and rotational momentum. I would suggest going over these topics at the beginning of next lecture."
"There seems to be confusion related to the material covered in class. Students were confused with some of the concepts in the triangle problem. Along with that, there was also confusion related to gravity and gravitational force. One student wanted a more in depth understanding of the formula.","There is a lot of confusion related to the material covered in class. Students would like more clarity related to gravity, superposition, and triangle of masses. I would suggest going over these topics at the beginning of next lecture."
There seems to be no confusion related to the material covered in class. Students really enjoyed the in-class problems and in-class demonstrations. I would suggest doing more of these in the future as well.,"There seems to be no confusion related to the material covered in class. Students really enjoyed the in-class demonstrations and problems. Along with that, they also enjoyed learning about inductance, current, and magnetic forces."
