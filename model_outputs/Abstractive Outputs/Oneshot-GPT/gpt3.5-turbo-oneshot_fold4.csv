Some students wanted a more in-depth explanation of the F = GMm/r^2 formula."
There seems to be no confusion related to the material covered in class. Students really enjoyed the in-class problems and in-class demonstrations. I would suggest doing more of these in the future as well.,The demonstrations and real-world applications of inductance were the most interesting aspects of today's class for many students. They found the mutual induction and solenoid problems particularly engaging.
