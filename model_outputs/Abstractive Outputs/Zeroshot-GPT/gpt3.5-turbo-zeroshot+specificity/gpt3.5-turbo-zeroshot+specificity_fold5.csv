"There seems to be confusion related to the material covered in class. Students would like more clarity over the sitting in the chair problem and tension problems. Along with that few students were confused with the set up of equations and general concepts related to inclines, forces, and accelaration.","Students found some topics in today's class confusing, including relating accelerations to objects, using formulas and setting up equations, understanding incline systems, tension problems, and visualizing forces on objects. One problem involving a man on a chair and pulley system was particularly unclear. Some students felt they needed more explanation and practice with free body diagrams."
There seems to be confusion related to the concepts covered in class. Students would like more clarity related to relative motion and projectile motion. Along with that students would like more explanation over the monkey problem and the problem related to the car. I would suggest going over these problems.,"Students generally understood the class on projectiles and relative motion, but some wished for more practice or explanation on certain examples. Some found vector notation and equations confusing, but with practice, they should improve."
"There seems to be no confusion related to the material covered in class. Students are really enjoyed the in-class demonstrations and the in-class practice problems. Along with that, they also enjoyed learning about angular momentum and applying it to some of their problems.","Students found various topics interesting in today's class, including finding speed of external objects, the relationship between angular and linear momentum, the demonstration with weights and a spinning chair, conservation of angular momentum, and examples and practice problems."
There seems to be no confusion related to the material covered in class. Students really enjoyed the live demonstrations in class. They especially liked watching the objects race down the hill as it helped them deepen their understanding of several physics concepts.,"Students found the demonstrations of different objects with different moments of inertia racing down the hill interesting. They also enjoyed the visual aids used to explain the concept of inertia and how it affects the speed of objects. The practical applications and practice problems, particularly those related to bicycles, were also appreciated."
There is a lot of confusion related to the material covered in class. Students don't have a clear understanding of the difference between types of acceleration. Along with that there is also confusion related to rotational kinematics. I would suggest going over these at the beginning of next class.,"Students were confused about various aspects of rotational motion, including the differences between angular, tangential, and centripetal acceleration, the direction of angular velocity and acceleration, and the use of kinematics equations for rotations. Some also struggled with converting between radians and revolutions."
"There is a lot of confusion related to the material covered in class. Students would like more clarity related to the rocket problem, types of collisions, and the bullet problem. I would suggest going over these at the beginning of next class.","Students found aspects of the rocket problem, elastic collisions, identifying collision types, completely inelastic collisions, and the explanation of the last question confusing in class. Some wished for more clarification on repeated collisions."
"There seems to be a lot of confusion related to the material covered in class. Students would like more clarity related to the power problem, graph problems, and potential energy problems. I would suggest going over these at the beginning of next lecture.","Students found today's class confusing in areas such as force body diagrams, potential energy problems, graphing acceleration with respect to time, and the power question. They also requested clarification on future problem-solving methods."
There is a lot of confusion related to the material covered in class. Students would like more clarity over the in-class problems and examples. Along with that there is also a lack of understanding over reflection and refraction. Students would also like a proper Trig Review before doing these problems.,"Students found various topics in today's class confusing, including refraction, trigonometry, polarizers, and the index of refraction. Some were unsure about the direction of light and which angle to use for calculations. The concept of photons and multiple surface reflections were also challenging."
