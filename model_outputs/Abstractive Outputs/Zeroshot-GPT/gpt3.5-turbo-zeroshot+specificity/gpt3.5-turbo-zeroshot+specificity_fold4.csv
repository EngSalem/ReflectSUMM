Some students especially enjoyed the tension and pulley problems.,"Students found the class interesting for various reasons, including the application of physics to different physical situations, the problem-solving process, and the use of diagrams to solve equations. The pulley problem and the reduction of weight by doubling tension were particularly fascinating."
"There is a lot of confusion related to the material covered in class. Students would like more clarity related to center of mass, impulse, and some of the problems covered in class. I would suggest going over these topics at the beginning of next class. ","Students were confused about various concepts in today's class, including the calculation of the center of mass for a projectile, the difference between impulse done onto something and impulse done by something, and the rope problem. However, some students felt they understood the material well."
There seems to be no confusion related to the material covered in class. Students enjoyed working on the in-class problems that related to velocity and energy. Some students enjoyed the problem that was used twice but included friction the second time to show the difference.,"Students found various topics interesting in today's physics class, including the relationship between energy and work, the application of conservation of energy in solving velocity problems, and the use of mathematical conversions. They also appreciated the smooth running of the online class."

They also enjoyed the examples used to explain concepts, such as the pool ball demonstration."
There seems to be no confusion related to the material covered in class. Students really enjoyed the demonstrations shown in class especially the ones related to simple harmonic motion and stress. One student enjoyed the modulus problem.,"Students found the demonstrations of simple harmonic motion and real-world examples interesting, as it helped with comprehension of the topic. They also found the concept of stress and strain intriguing, and enjoyed learning about how it applies to different types of pressures on objects."
"There is a lot of confusion related to the material covered in class. Students would like more clarity over inertia, angular momentum, and the in-class problems. I would suggest going over these at the beginning of next class.","Students found various topics confusing in today's class, including moment of inertia, conservation of momentum, and angular momentum for different objects. Some examples and explanations were unclear, and they struggled with using the correct equations."
"There seems to be confusion related to the material covered in class. Students were confused with some of the concepts in the triangle problem. Along with that, there was also confusion related to gravity and gravitational force. One student wanted a more in depth understanding of the formula.",Students found the direction of gravitational forces confusing and had difficulty with the triangle of masses problem. Some were unsure why G was negative in the first question and why two components were needed for gravity. They also wanted a more in-depth derivation of the F=GMm/r^2 formula.
There seems to be no confusion related to the material covered in class. Students really enjoyed the in-class problems and in-class demonstrations. I would suggest doing more of these in the future as well.,"Students found the demonstrations and real-world applications of inductors to be the most interesting part of class. They were particularly intrigued by the example of the moving loop, the solenoid and coil problem, and the connection to wireless chargers."
