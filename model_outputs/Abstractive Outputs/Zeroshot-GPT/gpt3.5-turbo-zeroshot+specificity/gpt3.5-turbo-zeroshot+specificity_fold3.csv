They also liked the car example and the crash problems.,"Students found various topics interesting in today's class, including the impact of variables on equations, calculating stopping distance, real-life applications of forces on car motion, and problem-solving examples."
"There seems to be no confusion related to material covered in class. Students really enjoyed the in-class demonstrations as it helped them deepen their understanding of the concepts related to energy, change in mass, etc.","The students found the in-person demonstrations very interesting, particularly the ones involving resonance, energy transfer and impact on frequency. They also found it fascinating that pendulums can finish swinging with the same time interval regardless of the height they are released from."
"There seems to be no confusion related to the material covered in class. Students enjoyed the demonstrations shown in class. Along with that students also enjoyed learning about waves, nodes, and frequencies.","The wave demonstrations, including standing waves and harmonics, were the most interesting parts of class. The relationship between k and w constants and the effect of tension on wave velocity were also noteworthy."
There seems to be no confusion related to the concepts covered in class. Students really enjoyed the live demonstrations in class. Some students liked the demonstration related to shooting the monkey while others liked the moving car demonstration.,"Students found the live demonstrations in class, especially the one involving shooting a monkey, to be the most interesting. They also appreciated the use of vectors in solving relative motion problems."
There seems to be confusion related to the material covered in class. Students would like more clarity related to the right hand rule and the left hand system. Along with that there was confusion related to the vectors questions covered in class.,"The students found the right hand rule for finding vector direction confusing and would have appreciated a clearer image. The cross product example was a bit fast-paced, and some students had trouble figuring out the direction of vectors. The rest of the lecture was mostly straightforward."
"There seems to be no confusion related to the material covered in class. Students really enjoyed the in-class demonstrations as it further deepened their understanding of concepts such as collisions, center of mass, and momentum.","Students found today's physics class interesting due to the live demonstrations, particularly the air track example and the momentum of a can being affected by a bullet. They appreciated the visual aids for understanding concepts such as elastic collisions and center of mass."
"There seems to be no confsuion related to the material covered in class. Students really enjoyed the in-class demonstrations as it helped them further deepen their understanding of concepts in light, refraction, and reflection.","The class found the demonstrations on light most interesting, particularly the ones on polarization, reflection, and refraction. They were fascinated by how light can be trapped in materials and how different mediums affect its behavior."
