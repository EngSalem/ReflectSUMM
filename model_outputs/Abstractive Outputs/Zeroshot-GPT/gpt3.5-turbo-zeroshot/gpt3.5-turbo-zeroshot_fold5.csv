I would suggest going over these at the beginning of next class.","Students found the rocket problem, identifying collision types, elastic collision equations, and center of mass of a propellant rocket most confusing. Clarification on collision types and elastic collision outcomes was requested for better understanding."
"There seems to be a lot of confusion related to the material covered in class. Students would like more clarity related to the power problem, graph problems, and potential energy problems. I would suggest going over these at the beginning of next lecture.","Students found today's class confusing due to unclear force body diagrams, potential energy problems involving springs and gravity, lack of tension consideration in power questions, and insufficient explanation on velocity graphs and problem-solving methods without integrals."
There is a lot of confusion related to the material covered in class. Students would like more clarity over the in-class problems and examples. Along with that there is also a lack of understanding over reflection and refraction. Students would also like a proper Trig Review before doing these problems.,"Students found understanding n1 and n2, trigonometry for refraction angles, and determining greater indexes perplexing. Concepts like total internal reflection, photons, and polarizers also posed challenges, along with practical calculations and applications."
