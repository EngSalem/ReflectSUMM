"These is a lot of confusion related to the material covered in class. Students would like more clarity related to collisions, amplitudes, and frequencies. Along with that, students also had doubts related to the in-class problems. I would suggest going over these at the beginning of next class.","
Students had difficulty understanding setting up energy problems, calculating frequency and amplitude, resonance, inelastic collisions and SHM. Demonstrations and clarification would be helpful."
There seems to be no confusion related to the material covered in class. Students enjoyed working with integrals and learning about how useful they are. Along with that students also enjoyed working with graphs and learning about area under the curve. A few students enjoyed the break down of the exam. ,"
Students found the topics of integrals, force, acceleration, and graph analysis interesting and enjoyed the exam breakdown. They were able to understand how integrals are related to work and velocity."
There seems to be no confusion related to the material covered in class. Students really enjoyed the in-class demonstrations and problems. They especially enjoyed the hair demo and were intrigued by measuring the width of hair.,"
Students found the demonstrations and applications of light diffraction to be interesting, such as measuring the width of a hair and calculating a satellite's resolution."
