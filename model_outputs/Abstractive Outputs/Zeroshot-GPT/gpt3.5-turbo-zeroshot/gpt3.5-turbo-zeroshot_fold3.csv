"There seems to be no confusion related to the material covered in class. Students enjoyed the demonstrations shown in class. Along with that students also enjoyed learning about waves, nodes, and frequencies.","
Students found the wave demonstrations, examples, and demos to be interesting and enjoyable. They appreciated seeing the direct application of the equations in the problems and the relationship between k and w."
There seems to be no confusion related to the concepts covered in class. Students really enjoyed the live demonstrations in class. Some students liked the demonstration related to shooting the monkey while others liked the moving car demonstration.,"
Students found the live demonstrations and experiments the most interesting, such as the monkey and the velocity vectors for relative motion problems. They enjoyed learning about Friction and setting up Friction Equations."
There seems to be confusion related to the material covered in class. Students would like more clarity related to the right hand rule and the left hand system. Along with that there was confusion related to the vectors questions covered in class.,"
Students found the right hand rule and vector direction confusing, but quickly understood the process of computing the dot and cross product. Clarification on the ways to find the sign/direction of the dot product and the purpose and use of the cross product would be beneficial."
"There seems to be no confusion related to the material covered in class. Students really enjoyed the in-class demonstrations as it further deepened their understanding of concepts such as collisions, center of mass, and momentum.","
Students found the live demonstrations engaging and helpful in understanding the concepts. They enjoyed learning about momentum, elastic energy, center of mass, and friction equations. They found elastic collisions particularly interesting."
"There seems to be no confsuion related to the material covered in class. Students really enjoyed the in-class demonstrations as it helped them further deepen their understanding of concepts in light, refraction, and reflection."," Students enjoyed the demonstrations in class, ranging from light experiments to polarization demos. They also found the laser demonstrations and the manipulation of light to be interesting and engaging."
