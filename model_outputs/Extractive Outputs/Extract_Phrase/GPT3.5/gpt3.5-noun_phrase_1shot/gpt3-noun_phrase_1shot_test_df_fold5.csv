 I found interesting the process of doing the WDM. It is quite complicated and with a lot of different tables, but doing it well can really help to narrow down to soecific ideas.
 How to make a weight decision chart which helps me to know what should I do with all my criterion and choices
 I enjoyed working on the prototypes with my group the most!
 Coming up with the criteria for a weighted decision matrix was very interesting, and finding the metric to measure that criteria on was also. 
 I found it interesting how we did the in-class activity before we did an example of how to make one.
 I did not find anything very interesting about today. The only thing slightly interesting was thinking about what major i want to go in to in the future.
 I found the weighted decision matrix to be most interesting as it seems to be very helpful for making choices and it can be applied to real life choices.
 I found the process of using the weighted matrix to go through further reflection and research in a solution to be the most interesting part of today’s class.
 how the design matrix works
 I thought the weighted matrix scale was very interesting 
 I found weighing the importance of each requirement very interesting
 Everything was very interesting!
 Working with my group and the decision matrix 
 The scale of the project keeps it interesting. 
 I really liked talking about car cost and matrix decisions
 I found it interesting how the design process is so extensive 
 I found it interesting how applicable weighted matrices are for lots of decisions.
 I liked how long we got to work on our project in class because it helped us form a plan
 The interesting part was actually comparing out prototypes and viewing their results
 Using weighted decision matrix in the real world was interesting
 How to use cad 
 The WDM was interesting and useful for other applications
 working on the design project and the in class activity
 I found how useful and the thought that went into weighted decision matrices were and how helpful WDMs are very interesting. 
 I found interesting how there are so many parts to get to the final solution. 
 Breakout room as we finished a lot homework!
 I liked how we did a sample WDM, it helped clear up some questions I had.
 In our break out room we discussed different polls to ask and I thought that was cool

 Prototype testing result 
 The weighted design matrix was quite interesting
 WDM
 I found it interesting how we can use the weighted decision matrix and figure out which solution is best for our problem.

 I find the new project very interesting. I love the idea of renewable energy. I like this because it's something I'm considering doing for a career.
 The different units of power, it's really weird why there are so many different ways to measure it. I am interested in looking into it.
 I thought that the most interesting thing in today's class was learning about the power generation of solar panels. 
 I found the discussion of electricity and power within the real world and how a large building such as a library has to address the costs of electricity 
 I found the way solar energy worked interesting 
 I thought the project we started working on today was very interesting and fun to work on
 Group time!!!
 Solar panels and the new project was interesting.
 How solar panels and other sources of energy are used.
 The different forms of energy and how they are generated was really interesting and hopefully we go more in depth with this topic.
 I found interesting about the number of units there are for energy. It's really cool. 
 Talking about in detail solar energy
 I liked the description of solar power and how costs are a factor.
 The discussion about the solar panels and the students responses about what they know was interesting.
 The most interesting part of today's class was working with my group.
 Mid term grades
 I was interested at starting a new project that has real world applications!
 how electricity is generated.
 I thought learning about solar energy was interesting.
 I found it interesting how solar panels work. 
 Assignment 13! ","Students are interested in the energy and power topic. Many students pointed to solar panels as the most interesting aspect of that discussion. This discussion seems to also raise interest in the new project and assignment, as well.

I found it very interesting who the class split up into small groups of 4 students. I believe that this was very important because I was able to talk to and get to know some people that will be in my class.
What I found most interesting is the programs and pre-planning of the group work and selection.
The professor being from Turkey was pretty interesting to me, I’ve never met someone from Turkey.
What the most important thing about the class for me was the grade breakdown. This way I know how I will be graded over the semester and what to expect.
The breakout rooms were really interesting and was nice to meet people!
I liked the activity where you drew what you expected an engineer to look like in 2030.
I found the drawing activity to be interesting and thought-provoking, as well as the poll and results that followed.
I found it interesting to get to know more people when we went into breakout rooms.
The most interesting thing in today’s class was how everyone interpreted what engineering would look like in 2030. Everybody had different visions, and i found that interesting.
I found that the breakout rooms were very interesting and quite informative as i was able to communicate with my classmates for the first time.
I found it interesting that we have several different types of advisors with different skills sets and experience to assist us in the course. Other courses usually have only one TA but it nice to have several people to ask for help
The use of the smaller rooms to talk with other classmates.
I had fun in the breakout rooms, because I liked talking with people, which I haven't done for awhile.
This was my first ever Zoom class so it was interesting to see how that worked.
The activity where we drew the future engineer I found it cool how everyone had different opinions and views.
I liked the overview of the class and the small group discussions. The people that I met seemed very kind and made me feel more comfortable in the class. I also appreciate the detail that Dr. M used when explaining each slide.

The class activity was interesting. 
Getting to know the professor and the peers
I loved the breakout rooms and the chance to meet new people. I also found the activity we did very interesting as well because I didn’t expect the questions you asked us afterwards to be so thought-provoking. 
I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help.
I found the breakout groups to be the most interesting. I had never used them before so it was a good learning experience.
I enjoyed the breakout sessions. They really allowed me to talk more in-depth with specific people, rather than just watching the instructor. It made the whole experience a lot more initiating and interactive. 
The people I met in my group 
I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activity of drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting. The layout is 4 main projects and I thought that it was cool to be in that format rather than many smaller projects. The drawing was interesting because it made you look to the future.
The most interesting thing I found was the logistics of the class and how we are supposed to complete projects
 I found the most interesting thing in today's class was the discussion we had with our breakout group about how engineers in 2030 would be like.
 I found the understanding of how the general aspects of the class would work to be interesting in today’s class.
 I found the projects and specifically the design project most interesting in class. 
 The interaction between the class, as well as what the content of the course is going to be. The breakout rooms were useful in getting to know the other students.
 Talking to my breakout group and meeting some of the class. 
 How we will get to work in teams, I want to get better at the collaboration.
 How many people did not draw an engineer in a lab.
 using the breakout rooms and getting to meet other people.
 I found the structure of the class to be most interesting. Most of my classes are a “go at your own pace” so it’s really refreshing to actually have the professor and others there to help answer questions.
 i liked learning about the breakout sessions 
 The future of engineering as drawn by today's engineers.
 I am new to the zoom breakout rooms and I like how simple it will be to create teams and meet with them.
 I thought the activity where we drew what an engineer would look like in 2030 was very interesting. I also thought the breakout groups were very fun and interesting since I didn’t know that was a feature on zoom.
 I think the way class is organized will be enjoyable and I am excited to begin!
 I found it interesting how we got a chance to meet other people right away. I also think that doing a drawing the first day to look back later is pretty cool too. 
 Talking to people about the future of engineering and what they wanted to do. It was also nice to see what out first project is going to be
 The slides with information on how to write a professional email, as that is new information for me. 
 Learning about future projects
 I found icebreaking and drawing very fun. 
 I found it interesting that many people changed their majors for engineering after this class. I also thought it was interesting that we are able to learn about all the different branches of engineering! 
 The breakout groups seem like they will make it easier to work with my group when I am sorted into it versus a giant group which would create issues with regards to easily conversing in class.
 The breakout sessions with the different members of this class was very interesting. Being able to share the different drawings with my peers along with getting their feedback was pretty fun!
 I liked seeing so many girls in the class. In my classes in high school, I was usually one of the only girls. So it was nice to see some diversity!
 I found the draw an engineer activity interesting

Getting to know the professor and the peers
I loved the breakout rooms and the chance to meet new people. I also found the activity we did very interesting as well because I didn't expect the questions you asked us afterwards to be so thought-provoking.
I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help.
I found the breakout groups to be the most interesting. I had never used them before so it was a good learning experience.
I enjoyed the breakout sessions. They really allowed me to talk more in-depth with specific people, rather than just watching the instructor. It made the whole experience a lot more initiating and interactive.
The people I met in my group
I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activity of drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting. The layout is 4 main projects and I thought that it was cool to be in that format rather than many smaller projects. The drawing was interesting because it made you look to the future.
The most interesting thing I found was the logistics of the class and how we are supposed to complete projects
I found the most interesting thing in today's class was the discussion we had with our breakout group about how engineers in 2030 would be like.
I found the understanding of how the general aspects of the class would work to be interesting in today's class.
I found the projects and specifically the design project most interesting in class.
The interaction between the class, as well as what the content of the course is going to be. The breakout rooms were useful in getting to know the other students.
Talking to my breakout group and meeting some of the class.
How we will get to work in teams, I want to get better at the collaboration.
How many people did not draw an engineer in a lab.
using the breakout rooms and getting to meet other people.
I found the structure of the class to be most interesting. Most of my classes are a “go at your own pace” so it's really refreshing to actually have the professor and others there to help answer questions.
i liked learning about the breakout sessions
The future of engineering as drawn by today's engineers.
I am new to the zoom breakout rooms and I like how simple it will be to create teams and meet with them.
I thought the activity where we drew what an engineer would look like in 2030 was very interesting. I also thought the breakout groups were very fun and interesting since I didn't know that was a feature on zoom.
I think the way class is organized will be enjoyable and I am excited to begin!
I found it interesting how we got a chance to meet other people right away. I also think that doing a drawing the first day to look back later is pretty cool too.
Talking to people about the future of engineering and what they wanted to do. It was also nice to see what out first project is going to be
The slides with information on how to write a professional email, as that is new information for me.
Learning about future projects
I found icebreaking and drawing very fun.
I found it interesting that many people changed their majors for engineering after this class. I also thought it was interesting that we are able to learn about all the different branches of engineering!
The breakout groups seem like they will make it easier to work with my group when I am sorted into it versus a giant group which would create issues with regards to easily conversing in class.
The breakout sessions with the different members of this class was very interesting. Being able to share the different drawings with my peers along with getting their feedback was pretty fun!
I liked seeing so many girls in the class. In my classes in high school, I was usually one of the only girls. So it was nice to see some diversity!

The pictures of the dam were amazing and it was interesting to use google scholar -> 4
Working on real projects that are also interesting -> 3
I thought learning about hydropower, the Taum Sauk reservoir, and a whole new project was interesting. -> 4
The reservoir -> 2
the hydro powered generators -> 3
I think learning about the reservoir, and doing some research on the history of the resource and about hydropower generators.  I think the introduction of a new project was very infesting. I also found the intro into how to cite and reference your sources to be very informative. -> 3
How hydropower generators worked -> 5
Learning about hydropower was most interesting. -> 2
I thought the way that HEP works was very interesting -> 4
I liked working with my group today -> 5
I found the modeling aspect of the new assignment interesting. I’m excited to learn more about that and figure the project out. -> 5
I found the complexity of hydroelectricity and the application of it in terms of our assignment to be interesting. -> 3
The new project about the dam. -> 3
I liked how we had group discussions I also liked how we got ahead on an assignment due next week and that we were given more time to work on projects so that we aren’t cramming many at once. -> 5
I’ve never had to use APA before this class, so that will be interesting -> 3
I found the discussion about Taum Sauk and how the hydropower generators work! -> 5
I found the new project we are starting very interesting. The fact that it can hold up to 1.5 billion gallons of water is insane. -> 3
A10 about the Taum Sauk Reservoir seems like it will be more intense than the Bike Share assignments. I believe that as a group, we will improve on the new set of assignments -> 4
Knowing about the articles and reliable sources available from the purdue library, that’s good information to have. -> 4
The whole concept is very interesting, using data and working with a dam is much more interesting than the bike share project -> 4
I liked all the time we got to work on A10 and I also liked how we were able to ask Neel questions if we were confused. It helped tremendously. -> 5
What I found most interesting is the taum Sauk reservoir and the failure that it had -> 3
hydropower is cool. I really like the Hoover dam. its important to note that despite being a renewable source of power, hydropower has one of the largest environmental impacts -> 2
I found the part about hydroelectric power very interesting. It is more interesting than the bike share project in my opinion. -> 3
I found learning about how hydroelectric dams work to be most interesting. It’s nice when you learn a little science on the side. Like a science side salad. With feta cheese. -> 4
I found the hydropower generator interesting. I didn’t really know how the generator converted mechanical energy into electric until today. -> 4
I thought that the introduction to the project and the data that came with it was interesting. I also liked the in class discussions of how information could be gathered and what questions to ask. -> 3
The idea that the Taum Sauk Reservoir is basically a free standing dam, but that it failed before and causes problems. However, we did not talk much as a group about the concepts behind it. -> 3
I liked how this upcoming project is more straightforward and more of the engineering I’m used to versus just plain data analysis. There is more formulas and things that I find fun. -> 3
I found the google scholar activity interesting. I enjoy doing research and liked getting the practice finding and citing different articles. -> 2
I found it interesting about the different ways you can find a relatable source. It is helpful to know more that one way to do so -> 2
I found learning about generators was interesting. I hope we get to learn more about how electricity is generated in future projects and assignments. -> 3
It was interesting to learn about the different types of resources we are allowed to use and it was interesting to research the Taum Sauk Reservoir. -> 4
I really like the taum Sauk project we are working on next and I think it will be very interesting because we get to model the system -> 4
I found the explanation of hydroelectric power interesting and I am excited for this next project we are undertaking. -> 4
How to properly cite your sources. -> 3
Seeing the mechanics of how reservoirs work -> 3
The Taum Sauk reservoir is an upper reservoir that failed and had an accident before. -> 2
The most interesting thing was looking into the past history of the Taum Sauk Reservoir. -> 4
I found the introduction of our next project very interesting today. Also, I feel like the time spent in breakout rooms during this lecture was much better than previous calls. -> 4
I found the video about how the reservoir works interesting -> 4
Class today went really well. The class discussion was very helpful, with what the company gave us and what we needed to find. I also believe that the work time at the end is very nice to half to get everything organized for our group to work on the project. -> 5
Hydropower is a very interesting concept that was talked about. -> 3
What I found most interesting in today’s class was how the whole process of hydropower works and how it creates power. -> 4
i found that the way that hydroelectric power is used is a very unique way. I knew a little about it, but i’m excited for the project that we’re doing to learn more about this. Also, i thought the amount of engineers working on dams was very interesting. -> 4
Today I was able to work with my group and we found out that Microsoft does have a sharing system which we heavily took advantage of. I am very happy with our group work and this will give us even better results. -> 4
I enjoyed looking at the statistics and working with my group in class 4a. -> 1
Learning about hydroelectric damns was interesting. This is because its a new and renweable power source with clear tradeoffs -> 4
I found the hydropower part interesting as I had previously learned some of this stuff in physics. -> 2
I enjoyed learning about hydropower and the company this project is based off of. -> 3
This class was a little dry, but the introduction to the project helped to clear up some thing that could have been confusing in the future. -> 5
the way that hydroelectric plants work was pretty interesting -> 4
Researching about the reservoir was interesting. -> 3
I found that learning about how power is generated by flowing water through a turbine was interesting. -> 3
I found interesting about using google scholar and integrating Purdue data base with it. -> 4
I found it interesting getting to see how the reservoir works and the applications of it that we will be analyzing. -> 3
The details of the new project we are beginning -> 3
I thought learning about the hydroelectric power was interesting -> 2
I found that it was important when we talked about information literacy -> 3
This reservoir is massive! Very interesting to research and I am excited to look into the data and learn more. -> 4

Similarly, many students expressed excitement about the new project, which seems to involve investigating how dams work as well. Students were interested in learning how to find good sources of information (e.g., on Google Scholar and Purdue Library), and students were also interested in how to properly cite those sources. Finally, students enjoyed working with their groups in breakout rooms today.","I thought learning about the hydroelectric power was interesting |_|  Seeing the mechanics of how reservoirs work  |_|  I found the introduction of our next project very interesting today.

there wasn't anything confusing today. -> 5
I think we could have went into greater detail with the repercussions that environmental proceeding have on engineering focus rather than focus on how environmental factors are proceeding -> 2
The way the carbon emission was calculated was a tad bit confusing. -> 1
I was confused about the in class activity at first but when I discussed it with my group we figured it out. -> 1
I did not find anything confusing in today’s class -> 1
Nothing was confusing in today’s class -> 1
One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how do you know if your assumptions are something the client would want you to make or if they are something they wouldn’t see relevant? -> 2
I found the carbon footprint information confusing because I was not sure how to take the environmental data from A13 and reflect a carbon footprint. -> 1
I was a little bit confused about how the in class activity related to the environmental analysis. I understand that we need to find the CO2 emissions in the economic analysis, but I don’t understand how the equation we used for the in class activity should be used in the environmental analysis. -> 3
Nothing confusing for today -> 3
it was somewhat difficult to get the calculations for the in class activity -> 3
There wasn’t really anything in today’s lecture that I found to be confusing or unclear. Everything stated was easily understood and tied in directly to being an engineer and our current project. Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society. -> 1
I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints -> 1

Something confusing in today’s class was the instructions for the new A17 assignment, because we were unsure of what to work on. -> 1
I was confused about how to apply bio mimicry to this project. -> 2
It was a very good class pretty productive got a lot of stuff done. -> 1
We went over each type of physical idea that could be made like bio mimicry. The concepts were a little confusing. -> 1
Nothing. The assignment made sense and what the goals of different perspectives and ideas play into finding a solution -> 1
I think we should have spent more time on how to create a functional decomposition chart -> 3
Nothing was confusing in today’s class. Everything made sense that he was talking about in terms of idea generation and what was expected for the project. -> 1
One thing that was confusing about today’s class was does brainstorming ideas have to relate specifically too the topic or can they be general stuff that can then be tied into the topic? -> 2
What parts of the technical brief that our group specifically needed to complete by next friday. -> 1
The only thing I was confused about was telling the difference between the different types of brain storming but I that is just because they are new -> 2
Everything was clear and straight forward -> 1
I thought that the emphasis on biomimicry was interesting, but I did not understand how it can be applied to our project. We are dealing with roads and traffic, so there is little I can see that the natural world can offer. -> 2
I found it a little confusing how we are supposed to use bio mimicry for a solution about campus mobility. -> 2
I thought an explanation of how biomimicry applied to our current assignment would have been helpful because I cannot think of how it is applicable. -> 2
How we are supposed to mimic animals and nature for the design project -> 4
I would have appreciated a greater discussion of what is reasonable to be discussing for ideas for increasing safety. I feel like I don’t have any idea of what scale I should be thinking on, what constraints I have in terms of money, etc. -> 5
I think it was a little confusing how biomimicry could be used for this project. There wasn’t really any relevant example provided for how we could use it. -> 3

Design process -> 3
Not a ton was interestinf, but I do think the prototype phase is an important part of this design process and will provide us with beneficial experience for the future -> 3
Even a detailed sketch can be a prototype. -> 3
Ways we found that might work to develop our prototype -> 2
I found learning about CAD softwares and 3D printing at Purdue most interesting. -> 4
I found the group time very helpful for assignment 18 -> 4
it was exciting that i can make something -> 2
Something interesting was learning about prototypes and how to make them, including the 3D printing lab that Purdue has. -> 3
Not much, it was mostly just a work day along with clarifications regarding why we build prototypes. -> 2
I enjoyed the class discussion. I thought it helped me understand what to focus on while prototyping. -> 2
Talking about the different materials we can use to make prototypes. I thought it was interesting that we can use anything from something as simple as cardboard and duct tape to CAD. I also liked Jeff’s costume. -> 5
The most interesting part of todays class was figuring out which of our solutions we will continue to use and make prototypes. Although it was hard to do, deciding on the solutions was still interesting -> 3
Something I found most interesting in today’s class was how many clients we have available to use to do prototyping. -> 5
What was due for assignment 17 -> 4
The discussion about next steps and designing prototypes -> 3
I found the brainstorming aspect of the class the most interesting because my team was flowing and the ideas were getting somewhere. The talk about prototyping was interesting and got me excited to work on the assignment. -> 3
The interesting part of class was the use of CAD to prototype. -> 5
The ways that we will evaluate each prototype. -> 1
I liked brainstorming in breakout rooms with  my group about how to do prototypes. -> 4
I found it interesting how effective CAD modeling can be for starting the prototyping phase, I also found it awesome how many services Purdue has to offer to aid in the prototyping process. -> 4
The act of prototyping is interesting because we can test our ideas. -> 2
It was interesting to learn about the ways to design a prototype. -> 1
Continuing through our next part of the project 17. Learning about engineering reflection guidelines -> 5
I like the idea of doing prototypes in general, especially how creative you can get while making/testing them. -> 4
I thought it was interesting when we learned all the softwares we can get for free from itap. -> 2
I’m enjoying this project as a whole and I’m looking forward to building and testing our prototypes. -> 3
What I said in the last slide<< prototyping discussion was very informative. -> 4
The fact that we can use surveys in order to obtain reliable prototype feedback. -> 3
It was really nice of robin to take time out of his busy schedule to come and visit our engineering class. -> 2
I found creating the prototypes with my team interesting. -> 5
I think it was interesting to come up with different ways to test the prototypes. -> 2
What I found most interesting about today’s class was all of the different clients that are available to perform virtual prototyping on. -> 4
I found it interesting how there is so many different ways we can try and represent our model -> 2
That being said, I liked considering and seeing how we would be able to build our own prototypes and test them as well as possibly implement them into the real world. -> 3
We didn’t do much just got some work done. -> 1
Some of the brainstormed ideas we came up with to prototype our solutions and judge their success. -> 4
I thought it was interesting to learn about how to prototype something. -> 5
expanding my knowledge on prototypes -> 5
designing our prototypes -> 5
We could use Fusion 360 officially for our CAD, which I already used. -> 3
It was interesting to start making prototypes of our design on here -> 3
I found working with my team interesting. -> 5
Modeling was the most interesting because I have always enjoyed modeling and look forward to creating prototypes from modeling again. -> 4
I like the idea of prototyping, I am very interested in the 3D prininyjng club to help out -> 5
I loved the breakout rooms today and our team got a lot of work done, especially narrowing down our six ideas to the top three. Also, we clarified our questions with Jeff Hall, who was extremely helpful!! We are excited to begin the next milestone. -> 5
Learning about the benefits of prototyping and how to prototype -> 4
The process of creating a prototype and methods of testing were interesting. -> 3
Everything :) -> 5
I found the wholistic approach of the design project very interesting and am very excited to move forward with it -> 4

This was the only thing that was a little confusing for me. -> 2
Everything was very well explained: I have no complaints! -> 1
Nothing in today’s class was super confusing. It was all pretty self explanatory. -> 1
I think that the example for pros and cons could have been better. I don’t drink coffee, so I didn’t really have much perspective for the problem. -> 2
I think the instructions on the  a17 assignement were not completely clear. I also had trouble understanding wether the costumer service introduction we had i  class needs to be included in our proyect or not -> 4
The extent of the in class assignment was the most confusing thing in today's class. Ex: how many pros and cons and geared towards what -> 1
Nothing was super confusing. At first I was worried because A17 is a lot, but once it was clarified that we didn’t need to do all of them it made a bit more sense. -> 1
I didn’t think anything was confusing for today’s class. I thought it all made sense and was very clear. One thing that I think could significantly improve our class is making the class slides available in Brightspace once the class begins. This would be very helpful to the teams, because often what we are working on in the assignment during team class time is related to what was in the slides and what we went over in the class. Having the slides as a reference would be extremely helpful to the teams in using their time most efficiently. -> 2
There are things that need more explanation of the assignment. -> 3
I was confused as to how to use/create the chart under functional decomposition but my team helped me out. -> 2
I thought the biomimicry idea generation was difficult to apply in our assignment. -> 2
Not much, the explanation regarding assignment 17 was straightforward, and the topic discussed of pros and cons was simple. -> 1
I thought that finding implicit criteria was confusing and could have used more details. This is confusing because I’m not sure on how to look for them. -> 3
How we should go about receiving advice for future iterations. -> 2
I wasn’t confused on any concept from today’s class. -> 1
We needed more details on the background information for the in class activity. -> 1
Something that needed more detail was the type of solution necessary because of the issue of prototyping. -> 4
There wasn’t much confusing material in the zoom I thought it was really helpful hearing our expectations on what we needed to do for a17 -> 1
The assignment was a little confusing because my team was doing the entire section four and did not realize that we only had to do a few parts. Also, the functional decomposition part of the assignment was confusing, however, the PT was a great help. -> 3
Not in today’s class but in the previous class because my team didn’t realize we needed to do iteration one or that we only needed to do 2 of the idea generation parts, but it wasn’t much. -> 2
How to properly analyze the pros and cons of the coffee makers -> 1
I don’t have much confusing feedback to give for this class. Everything was pretty clear during the lecture. -> 1
I was not aware that only 2 of the methods of idea generation were required for A17. -> 3
I thought the in class activity was a little confusing, as we didn’t have access to any materials for the keurig or french press. I had never even heard of a french press before this. It would’ve been good if we had been told that we needed to use the internet to find this information. -> 3
There was nothing confusing about todays class. Class was productive and straight forward. My group worked well today on organizing the solutions into categories, and the TA’s helped good today too. -> 1
I was confused as to how indepth the pro’s and con’s diagram should be. -> 1
The exact parameters for the French press were confusing because it never said if it was the large variant or not. -> 2
The different steps to the final project -> 3
Something confusing in today’s class was the exact sections required for A17, because a TA told us that parts of A17 were due for A16 so we ended up being a little bit ahead on work. -> 2
There was nothing confusing. Class was straightforward and productive. I appreciate the help of the TAs in our ideal work time. -> 1
None -> 1
I was initially confused about the current assignment's requirements. -> 2
I thought it was a bit confusing when we were told to discuss the pros and cons of a french press and I had no idea how a french press worked, but I did some research and was able to figure it out. it was just confusing at first. -> 2
I was confused on the part about why we had so many different ways to come up with ideas for A17. -> 2
everything was pretty clear -> 1
I didn’t find anything that was too confusing in today’s class. -> 1
The clarification on what a french press roaster is versus what a keurig is as some people did not know about them. -> 2
Nothing needs more details -> 1

Nothing today -> 1
What we are supposed to do for the iteration part -> 3
nothing -> 1
One thing that was confusing about today’s class was are the exploring prior art supposed to be just general things being done or are they supposed to relate specifically to our ideas that we generated? -> 3
Nothing was confusing in today’s class! The in-class activity made a lot of sense and really helped us when generating ideas. -> 1

49,94,94,Alex,engr131_s015-fall2020,5,Describe what was confusing or needed more details in today's class?,"A few answers to questions, particularly about discrete vs continuous and numerical vs categorical data types, were difficult to understand. It wouldv’e been nice to hear another perspective or source about these, maybe a GTA or PT’s opinion as well. -> 4
It was a little bit confusing figuring out how to edit the overflow data. Also, this is part of the Modules not the class but I don’t understand why the center of a bin is not just the middle number of that bins range (in the module 31 was not the answer for the range 30-32). -> 1
I didn’t understand how to format the histogram axis in excel. Excel automatically adjusts bin width and bin numbers -> 2
The part of class that was confusing was how to find bin width. Or more of once you find it do you need to round it up or to the nearest whole number? -> 2
It is difficult for mac users to submit assignments and edit in excel so more information on how to do assignments would be helpful. -> 2
In today’s class, it was unclear about whether the data in the in class activity was numerical or categorical or ordinal and nominal. -> 2
Determining the bin’s upper limit and underflow -> 4
The overall clarification for the data types was still somewhat confusing. The person who asked about time brought up a good point. -> 2
How to make histograms was confusing. Jeff told our group in the breakout room that we have to base the histogram off of bin width, not bin number. This wasn’t clear in the modules or lecture. -> 4
I feel like i have more questions regarding histograms but since I didnt have enough time to tinker with them in excel i couldnt get to ask them. Should I over prepare for classes? -> 3
The different types of data keep confusing me, especially the difference between the numerical data. -> 3
I thought that the choosing which graph to use part of class was confusing today. I am still confused about nominal vs ordinal and numerical vs categorical. -> 4
The pdf that says what to do for A07 has confusing instructions for what to do with the histograms -> 3
I did not understand how exactly to set the correct bi  width and number in excel for mac. Everytime I place the calculated values, the ranges do not equal whole numbers. -> 3
Nothing was overly confusing besides the conversation about if hourly data points are continuous or discrete. -> 1
Assignment 7 is alittle confusing but I will be reading through it to understand it better. But working with the Excel graph was helpful -> 3
It would be nice if the announcements were on a separate presentation, and reposted on bright space in another tab under content. -> 1
I was confused by the choice of line graph for the in-class assignment. I thought a histogram was the obvious choice as it shows frequency and the question being asked was about low usage, which would be easily identified as a point with low frequency on a histogram. I think the line graph, on the other hand, would have been a better choice if the question was asking about a trend in time, such as: during which intervals of time is the usage increasing? -> 1
Determining what type of data is what, like discrete, nominal, etc. -> 4
I think most of my confusion around histograms was cleared up today but my confusion with excel is still pretty high. For example, I can’t figure out how to order a set of data unless it’s within a pivot table. Also, I’m having trouble making the differences between numerica continuous and numerical discrete data clear. -> 4
Understanding how to specifically format parts of graphs(like the axes) in Excel is confusing. -> 3
One thing that confused me in todays class was how we would go about renaming the document we were supposed to submit for the in class activity. Another thing that confused me was in the in class activity and when we are supposed to submit it. Are we required to submit before exiting the breakout? -> 2
I thought the explanation of how each component of the histograms  are found to be somewhat confusing. -> 2
I am still a little bit unclear on how to work some of the aspects on excel including changing the axis value on a Mac. I would suggest a little bit longer on working through excel. Not necessary, though. -> 2
I would’ve appreciated more time spent on how to adjust the histogram bin range and number of bins to get nice numbers for the axes. -> 4
The process of creating a histogram on Mac. One of my teammate’s struggled with this and I wasn’t sure how to help. -> 3
I did not find anything confusing, and did not need more details in anything. -> 1
I am confused if you find your bin width to have a decimal in it, do you round that up or down to keep the graph nice with no decimals or do you just leave it. -> 4
Today’s lesson was straightforward except the part about histograms and mac users. -> 3
This is separate, but could we receive a little bit more time in the breakout rooms before the PT’s enter the room? A lot of the time we are just reading the instructions and haven’t really gotten into the assignment yet, so we don’t have any questions until after they leave. I am also on Team 07, so I may just be early in the order. Thanks, Kyle -> 3
More instruction on how the Assignment 7 would work. It was very confusing and I don’t have a good grasp from what was told. Everything I tried seems wrong. -> 3
I found that some of the data listed in the in class activity was confusing. They were not distinctly categorized as discrete or nominal, such as time. -> 1
Overall the content today was not confusing I was able to follow along and understand what was happening. -> 1
I thought that everything was fairly easy. The most difficult part is sometimes identifying the type of data being used since some numbers are occasionally still categorical. -> 1
Nothing was really confusing about today’s class. -> 1
The only confusing part about today was determining what the data type was for the time in the in class activity. I thought it was continuous but it ended up being discrete. It was a little confusing to understand at first but I realized once we discussed it as a class. Also figuring out how to use histograms was a bit confusing at first, but I was able to figure that out easily. -> 2
I thought that the discussion on discrete vs continuous data during the part on chart selection confused me a bit. -> 1
I feel like the guidance on how we are supposed to complete and do assignments is minimal, and I feel like we the students don’t have the ability to reach out for help from the instructor or a TA when we are in our small groups. -> 2
I think continuous and discrete data is still confusing so it would be good if you could go over that more in depth with multiple examples. -> 4
I really have a hard time doing the in class activities because I feel like we have very little time and I’m almost never finished by the time I’m called back to the main room. I would appreciate if this time would be longer so that I can finish the activity in time. -> 2
Test -> 3
Everything made sense. -> 1
nothing was really confusing in today's class, everything was pretty straightforward and easy. -> 1
I was confused by how exactly to determine bon intervals on the histograms. -> 3
I could have used some more explanation for how to make histograms on a Mac. -> 3
Whether data is discrete or continuous and which type of graph to use based on this information. I didn’t know a line chart could be used for discrete data, I originally thought that would only apply to continuous. -> 2
When we are setting the bin width do we round up or down? Same with # of bins -> 3
Under flow and over flow -> 4
We definitely needed more time to look at the types of skews associated with histograms. Additionally, it would’ve been nice to look a little closer into the types of data. (Nominal, categorical, ordinal, etc.) -> 3
How to adjust bin / find bin range probably needed more time dedicated to it. It was confusing, I still don’t fully understand how to actually adjust bins and/or find bin range. -> 3
I was confused on to set up a histogram. I didn’t know how to set them up and format them. -> 4
Some of the histogram stuff was fast -> 2
The different types of data almost look subjective to me, so a more in-depth explanation would be nice. -> 2
When to use each visualization method and the different types of data. It’s difficult to find the resources. -> 1
Time as a data type was confusing because it could be discrete in some cases but continuous in others, making it a little vague for defining it. The fact that it doesn’t have a true answer makes it confusing because it makes it difficult to decide what type to classify it as in the future on our personal assignments. -> 4

Formating histograms correctly. bin width, number of bins, bin edges. -> 1
I do not understand how we are intended to reconcile bin width, number of bins, and bin borders in A07 without an extremely large underflow. The problem dictates that there must be exactly 18 bins with integer borders, but in part 2 this would require such a large underflow that it distorts the remaining data. -> 4
I found how to adjust bin sizes to fit the data better in excel to be unclear to me. I fiddled with the settings for the histogram in excel but I felt like I was just blindly moving values around. -> 4

For A07, I am confused on how we customize the bin widths AND number of bins. After calculating how many bins I need for Table 1, the result is 18. However, when I set the number of bins to 18, the bin width prepopulates to 4.4444 when it should be 5. But, it doesn’t allow me to change it.

I would like more clarification on how excel worksheets work for example i was confused on how you got over flow and under flows working and it was confusing for the team causing us to stay confused on how to make the histogram. -> 3
I could not determine what to do if a histogram was a decimal for the bins width and if it were decimal intervals when using the bin number instead. For the histograms, I know how to find each of those values, but when making the graph I don’t know how to alter/change them if the graph still doesn’t look nice. -> 1","A few answers to questions, particularly about discrete vs continuous and numerical vs categorical data types, were difficult to understand.

It was a little bit confusing figuring out how to edit the overflow data. Also, this is part of the Modules not the class but I don’t understand why the center of a bin is not just the middle number of that bins range (in the module 31 was not the answer for the range 30-32). -> 4
I didn’t understand how to format the histogram axis in excel. Excel automatically adjusts bin width and bin numbers -> 4

Assignment 7 is alittle confusing but I will be reading through it to understand it better. But working with the Excel graph was helpful -> 3
It would be nice if the announcements were on a separate presentation, and reposted on bright space in another tab under content. -> 4
I was confused by the choice of line graph for the in-class assignment. I thought a histogram was the obvious choice as it shows frequency and the question being asked was about low usage, which would be easily identified as a point with low frequency on a histogram. I think the line graph, on the other hand, would have been a better choice if the question was asking about a trend in time, such as: during which intervals of time is the usage increasing? -> 4
Determining what type of data is what, like discrete, nominal, etc. -> 3
I think most of my confusion around histograms was cleared up today but my confusion with excel is still pretty high. For example, I can’t figure out how to order a set of data unless it’s within a pivot table. Also, I’m having trouble making the differences between numerica continuous and numerical discrete data clear. -> 4
Understanding how to specifically format parts of graphs(like the axes) in Excel is confusing. -> 3

Today’s lesson was straightforward except the part about histograms and mac users. -> 3
This is separate, but could we receive a little bit more time in the breakout rooms before the PT’s enter the room?

The only confusing part about today was determining what the data type was for the time in the in class activity. I thought it was continuous but it ended up being discrete.

I think continuous and discrete data is still confusing so it would be good if you could go over that more in depth with multiple examples. -> 4
I really have a hard time doing the in class activities because I feel like we have very little time and I’m almost never finished by the time I’m called back to the main room. I would appreciate if this time would be longer so that I can finish the activity in time. -> 4

I feel like the guidance on how we are supposed to complete and do assignments is minimal, and I feel like we the students don’t have the ability to reach out for help from the instructor or a TA when we are in our small groups.
I think continuous and discrete data is still confusing so it would be good if you could go over that more in depth with multiple examples.
I really have a hard time doing the in class activities because I feel like we have very little time and I’m almost never finished by the time I’m called back to the main room. I would appreciate if this time would be longer so that I can finish the activity in time.
Test
Everything made sense.
nothing was really confusing in today's class, everything was pretty straightforward and easy.
I was confused by how exactly to determine bon intervals on the histograms.
I could have used some more explanation for how to make histograms on a Mac.
Whether data is discrete or continuous and which type of graph to use based on this information. I didn’t know a line chart could be used for discrete data, I originally thought that would only apply to continuous.
When we are setting the bin width do we round up or down? Same with # of bins
Under flow and over flow
We definitely needed more time to look at the types of skews associated with histograms. Additionally, it would’ve been nice to look a little closer into the types of data. (Nominal, categorical, ordinal, etc.)
How to adjust bin / find bin range probably needed more time dedicated to it. It was confusing, I still don’t fully understand how to actually adjust bins and/or find bin range.
I was confused on to set up a histogram. I didn’t know how to set them up and format them.
Some of the histogram stuff was fast
The different types of data almost look subjective to me, so a more in-depth explanation would be nice.
When to use each visualization method and the different types of data. It’s difficult to find the resources.
Time as a data type was confusing because it could be discrete in some cases but continuous in others, making it a little vague for defining it. The fact that it doesn’t have a true answer makes it confusing because it makes it difficult to decide what type to classify it as in the future on our personal assignments.
I feel like we glossed over a lot of the explanations which left ambiguity on creating histograms for me. Also I’m really confused on classifying data as continuous or discrete and nominal or ordinal
Formating histograms correctly. bin width, number of bins, bin edges.
I do not understand how we are intended to reconcile bin width, number of bins, and bin borders in A07 without an extremely large underflow. The problem dictates that there must be exactly 18 bins with integer borders, but in part 2 this would require such a large underflow that it distorts the remaining data.
I found how to adjust bin sizes to fit the data better in excel to be unclear to me. I fiddled with the settings for the histogram in excel but I felt like I was just blindly moving values around.
The only part of today’s class was being able to identify the type of data. For example, I sometimes have trouble telling whether data is continuous or discrete. Also, it can be difficult to choose what type of chart to use based on what type of data it is.
Details about which graphs to use when.
How to know what data representation method to chose given data. Also how to edit histograms within excel. How to calculate bin width and how many bins. Slides were very clean and descriptive.
A little bit more info about the quiz, like how should we study for it or what to read. Also, I would like feedback on my work to see if I’m doing things well.
This class was fairly straightforward, nothing was really confusing
Using the Excel software on Mac was confusing, but Professor Menekse covered it well. The things I was confused about earlier in the class were mostly answered by the end of class.
The only confusing part was discussing, categorical and numerical data.
I was confused about the situations when you would use a histogram over a line chart and vice versa as well as situations when both are viable options.
For A07, I am confused on how we customize the bin widths AND number of bins. After calculating how many bins I need for Table 1, the result is 18. However, when I set the number of bins to 18, the bin width prepopulates to 4.4444 when it should be 5. But, it doesn’t allow me to change it. Thus, I went ahead and made my bin width 5 and my number of bins 16.
The explanation of the answers of the in-class activity. I had a few questions and we had to keep going back to it
This class was generally clear and understandable but the task a07 it self was what was confusing to me
I enjoyed the class it was very informative on the different types of graphs. I think I understand then much more than I did before.
I was confused as to what slack is and what it is used for
talking about the in class assignment was slightly confusing with whether time was continuous or discrete
I think today’s class was good. There was a enough explanation about the EYM and the histogram assignments, as well as the upcoming quiz for Friday.
what is discrete number and what is numerical
I would like more clarification on how excel worksheets work for example i was confused on how you got over flow and under flows working and it was confusing for the team causing us to stay confused on how to make the histogram.
I could not determine what to do if a histogram was a decimal for the bins width and if it were decimal intervals when using the bin number instead. For the histograms, I know how to find each of those values, but when making the graph I don’t know how to alter/change them if the graph still doesn’t look nice.","A few answers to questions, particularly about discrete vs continuous and numerical vs categorical data types, were difficult to understand. It wouldv’e been nice to hear another perspective or source about these, maybe a GTA or PT’s opinion as well.
It was a little bit confusing figuring out how to edit the overflow data. Also, this is part of the Modules not the class but I don’t understand why the center of a bin is not just the middle number of that bins range (in the module 31 was not the answer for the range 30-32). 
I didn’t understand how to format the histogram axis in excel. Excel automatically adjusts bin width and bin numbers
The part of class that was confusing was how to find bin width. Or more of once you find it do you need to round it up or to the nearest whole number?
It is difficult for mac users to submit assignments and edit in excel so more information on how to do assignments would be helpful.
In today’s class, it was unclear about whether the data in the in class activity was numerical or categorical or ordinal and nominal.
Determining the bin’s upper limit and underflow
The overall clarification for the data types was still somewhat confusing. The person who asked about time brought up a good point.
How to make histograms was confusing. Jeff told our group in the breakout room that we have to base the histogram off of bin width, not bin number. This wasn’t clear in the modules or lecture. 
I feel like i have more questions regarding histograms but since I didnt have enough time to tinker with them in excel i couldnt get to ask them. Should I over prepare for classes?
 The different types of data keep confusing me, especially the difference between the numerical data.
 I thought that the choosing which graph to use part of class was confusing today. I am still confused about nominal vs ordinal and numerical vs categorical.
 The pdf that says what to do for A07 has confusing instructions for what to do with the histograms 
 I did not understand how exactly to set the correct bi  width and number in excel for mac. Everytime I place the calculated values, the ranges do not equal whole numbers.
 Nothing was overly confusing besides the conversation about if hourly data points are continuous or discrete.
 Assignment 7 is alittle confusing but I will be reading through it to understand it better. But working with the Excel graph was helpful 
 It would be nice if the announcements were on a separate presentation, and reposted on bright space in another tab under content. 
 I was confused by the choice of line graph for the in-class assignment. I thought a histogram was the obvious choice as it shows frequency and the question being asked was about low usage, which would be easily identified as a point with low frequency on a histogram. I think the line graph, on the other hand, would have been a better choice if the question was asking about a trend in time, such as: during which intervals of time is the usage increasing?
 Determining what type of data is what, like discrete, nominal, etc.
 I think most of my confusion around histograms was cleared up today but my confusion with excel is still pretty high. For example, I can’t figure out how to order a set of data unless it’s within a pivot table. Also, I’m having trouble making the differences between numerica continuous and numerical discrete data clear.
 Understanding how to specifically format parts of graphs(like the axes) in Excel is confusing. 
 One thing that confused me in todays class was how we would go about renaming the document we were supposed to submit for the in class activity. Another thing that confused me was in the in class activity and when we are supposed to submit it. Are we required to submit before exiting the breakout? 
 I thought the explanation of how each component of the histograms  are found to be somewhat confusing. 
 I am still a little bit unclear on how to work some of the aspects on excel including changing the axis value on a Mac. I would suggest a little bit longer on working through excel. Not necessary, though. 
 I would’ve appreciated more time spent on how to adjust the histogram bin range and number of bins to get nice numbers for the axes.
 The process of creating a histogram on Mac. One of my teammate’s struggled with this and I wasn’t sure how to help.
 I did not find anything confusing, and did not need more details in anything.
 I am confused if you find your bin width to have a decimal in it, do you round that up or down to keep the graph nice with no decimals or do you just leave it. 
 Today’s lesson was straightforward except the part about histograms and mac users. 
 This is separate, but could we receive a little bit more time in the breakout rooms before the PT’s enter the room? A lot of the time we are just reading the instructions and haven’t really gotten into the assignment yet, so we don’t have any questions until after they leave. I am also on Team 07, so I may just be early in the order. Thanks, Kyle
 More instruction on how the Assignment 7 would work. It was very confusing and I don’t have a good grasp from what was told. Everything I tried seems wrong.
 I found that some of the data listed in the in class activity was confusing. They were not distinctly categorized as discrete or nominal, such as time.
 Overall the content today was not confusing I was able to follow along and understand what was happening.
 I thought that everything was fairly easy. The most difficult part is sometimes identifying the type of data being used since some numbers are occasionally still categorical.
 Nothing was really confusing about today’s class.
 The only confusing part about today was determining what the data type was for the time in the in class activity. I thought it was continuous but it ended up being discrete. It was a little confusing to understand at first but I realized once we discussed it as a class. Also figuring out how to use histograms was a bit confusing at first, but I was able to figure that out easily.

Time as a data type was confusing because it could be discrete in some cases but continuous in others, making it a little vague for defining it. The fact that it doesn't have a true answer makes it confusing because it makes it difficult to decide what type to classify it as in the future on our personal assignments. -> 4

I do not understand how we are intended to reconcile bin width, number of bins, and bin borders in A07 without an extremely large underflow. The problem dictates that there must be exactly 18 bins with integer borders, but in part 2 this would require such a large underflow that it distorts the remaining data. -> 4
I found how to adjust bin sizes to fit the data better in excel to be unclear to me. I fiddled with the settings for the histogram in excel but I felt like I was just blindly moving values around. -> 4

For A07, I am confused on how we customize the bin widths AND number of bins. After calculating how many bins I need for Table 1, the result is 18. However, when I set the number of bins to 18, the bin width prepopulates to 4.4444 when it should be 5. But, it doesn't allow me to change it.

I could not determine what to do if a histogram was a decimal for the bins width and if it were decimal intervals when using the bin number instead.

Nothing was overly confusing besides the conversation about if hourly data points are continuous or discrete. -> 3
Assignment 7 is alittle confusing but I will be reading through it to understand it better. But working with the Excel graph was helpful -> 3
It would be nice if the announcements were on a separate presentation, and reposted on bright space in another tab under content. -> 4
I was confused by the choice of line graph for the in-class assignment. I thought a histogram was the obvious choice as it shows frequency and the question being asked was about low usage, which would be easily identified as a point with low frequency on a histogram. I think the line graph, on the other hand, would have been a better choice if the question was asking about a trend in time, such as: during which intervals of time is the usage increasing? -> 4
Determining what type of data is what, like discrete, nominal, etc. -> 3
I think most of my confusion around histograms was cleared up today but my confusion with excel is still pretty high. For example, I can't figure out how to order a set of data unless it's within a pivot table. Also, I'm having trouble making the differences between numerica continuous and numerical discrete data clear. -> 4
Understanding how to specifically format parts of graphs(like the axes) in Excel is confusing. -> 3

This is separate, but could we receive a little bit more time in the breakout rooms before the PT's enter the room? A lot of the time we are just reading the instructions and haven't really gotten into the assignment yet, so we don't have any questions until after they leave. I am also on Team 07, so I may just be early in the order. Thanks, Kyle -> 4

I thought that everything was fairly easy. The most difficult part is sometimes identifying the type of data being used since some numbers are occasionally still categorical. -> 4
Nothing was really confusing about today's class. -> 1
The only confusing part about today was determining what the data type was for the time in the in class activity. I thought it was continuous but it ended up being discrete. It was a little confusing to understand at first but I realized once we discussed it as a class. Also figuring out how to use histograms was a bit confusing at first, but I was able to figure that out easily. -> 4
I thought that the discussion on discrete vs continuous data during the part on chart selection confused me a bit. -> 3
I feel like the guidance on how we are supposed to complete and do assignments is minimal, and I feel like we the students don't have the ability to reach out for help from the instructor or a TA when we are in our small groups. -> 4
I think continuous and discrete data is still confusing so it would be good if you could go over that more in depth with multiple examples. -> 4
I really have a hard time doing the in class activities because I feel like we have very little time and I'm almost never finished by the time I'm called back to the main room. I would appreciate if this time would be longer so that I can finish the activity in time. -> 4

A lot of the time we are just reading the instructions and haven't really gotten into the assignment yet, so we don't have any questions until after they leave. I am also on Team 07, so I may just be early in the order. Thanks, Kyle
More instruction on how the Assignment 7 would work. It was very confusing and I don't have a good grasp from what was told. Everything I tried seems wrong.
I found that some of the data listed in the in class activity was confusing. They were not distinctly categorized as discrete or nominal, such as time.
Overall the content today was not confusing I was able to follow along and understand what was happening.
I thought that everything was fairly easy. The most difficult part is sometimes identifying the type of data being used since some numbers are occasionally still categorical.
Nothing was really confusing about today's class.
The only confusing part about today was determining what the data type was for the time in the in class activity. I thought it was continuous but it ended up being discrete. It was a little confusing to understand at first but I realized once we discussed it as a class. Also figuring out how to use histograms was a bit confusing at first, but I was able to figure that out easily.
I thought that the discussion on discrete vs continuous data during the part on chart selection confused me a bit.
I feel like the guidance on how we are supposed to complete and do assignments is minimal, and I feel like we the students don't have the ability to reach out for help from the instructor or a TA when we are in our small groups.
I think continuous and discrete data is still confusing so it would be good if you could go over that more in depth with multiple examples.
I really have a hard time doing the in class activities because I feel like we have very little time and I'm almost never finished by the time I'm called back to the main room. I would appreciate if this time would be longer so that I can finish the activity in time.
Test
Everything made sense.
nothing was really confusing in today's class, everything was pretty straightforward and easy.
I was confused by how exactly to determine bon intervals on the histograms.
I could have used some more explanation for how to make histograms on a Mac.
Whether data is discrete or continuous and which type of graph to use based on this information. I didn't know a line chart could be used for discrete data, I originally thought that would only apply to continuous.
When we are setting the bin width do we round up or down? Same with # of bins
Under flow and over flow
We definitely needed more time to look at the types of skews associated with histograms. Additionally, it would've been nice to look a little closer into the types of data. (Nominal, categorical, ordinal, etc.)
How to adjust bin / find bin range probably needed more time dedicated to it. It was confusing, I still don't fully understand how to actually adjust bins and/or find bin range.
I was confused on to set up a histogram. I didn't know how to set them up and format them.
Some of the histogram stuff was fast
The different types of data almost look subjective to me, so a more in-depth explanation would be nice.
When to use each visualization method and the different types of data. It's difficult to find the resources.
Time as a data type was confusing because it could be discrete in some cases but continuous in others, making it a little vague for defining it. The fact that it doesn't have a true answer makes it confusing because it makes it difficult to decide what type to classify it as in the future on our personal assignments.
I feel like we glossed over a lot of the explanations which left ambiguity on creating histograms for me. Also I'm really confused on classifying data as continuous or discrete and nominal or ordinal
Formating histograms correctly. bin width, number of bins, bin edges.
I do not understand how we are intended to reconcile bin width, number of bins, and bin borders in A07 without an extremely large underflow. The problem dictates that there must be exactly 18 bins with integer borders, but in part 2 this would require such a large underflow that it distorts the remaining data.
I found how to adjust bin sizes to fit the data better in excel to be unclear to me. I fiddled with the settings for the histogram in excel but I felt like I was just blindly moving values around.
The only part of today's class was being able to identify the type of data. For example, I sometimes have trouble telling whether data is continuous or discrete. Also, it can be difficult to choose what type of chart to use based on what type of data it is.
Details about which graphs to use when.
How to know what data representation method to chose given data. Also how to edit histograms within excel. How to calculate bin width and how many bins. Slides were very clean and descriptive.
A little bit more info about the quiz, like how should we study for it or what to read. Also, I would like feedback on my work to see if I'm doing things well.
This class was fairly straightforward, nothing was really confusing
Using the Excel software on Mac was confusing, but Professor Menekse covered it well. The things I was confused about earlier in the class were mostly answered by the end of class.
The only confusing part was discussing, categorical and numerical data.
I was confused about the situations when you would use a histogram over a line chart and vice versa as well as situations when both are viable options.
For A07, I am confused on how we customize the bin widths AND number of bins. After calculating how many bins I need for Table 1, the result is 18. However, when I set the number of bins to 18, the bin width prepopulates to 4.4444 when it should be 5. But, it doesn't allow me to change it. Thus, I went ahead and made my bin width 5 and my number of bins 16.
The explanation of the answers of the in-class activity. I had a few questions and we had to keep going back to it
This class was generally clear and understandable but the task a07 it self was what was confusing to me
I enjoyed the class it was very informative on the different types of graphs. I think I understand then much more than I did before.
I was confused as to what slack is and what it is used for
talking about the in class assignment was slightly confusing with whether time was continuous or discrete
I think today's class was good. There was a enough explanation about the EYM and the histogram assignments, as well as the upcoming quiz for Friday.
what is discrete number and what is numerical
I would like more clarification on how excel worksheets work for example i was confused on how you got over flow and under flows working and it was confusing for the team causing us to stay confused on how to make the histogram.
I could not determine what to do if a histogram was a decimal for the bins width and if it were decimal intervals when using the bin number instead. For the histograms, I know how to find each of those values, but when making the graph I don't know how to alter/change them if the graph still doesn't look nice.","A few answers to questions, particularly about discrete vs continuous and numerical vs categorical data types, were difficult to understand. It wouldv'e been nice to hear another perspective or source about these, maybe a GTA or PT's opinion as well.
It was a little bit confusing figuring out how to edit the overflow data. Also, this is part of the Modules not the class but I don't understand why the center of a bin is not just the middle number of that bins range (in the module 31 was not the answer for the range 30-32). 
I didn't understand how to format the histogram axis in excel. Excel automatically adjusts bin width and bin numbers
The part of class that was confusing was how to find bin width. Or more of once you find it do you need to round it up or to the nearest whole number?
It is difficult for mac users to submit assignments and edit in excel so more information on how to do assignments would be helpful.
In today's class, it was unclear about whether the data in the in class activity was numerical or categorical or ordinal and nominal.
Determining the bin's upper limit and underflow
The overall clarification for the data types was still somewhat confusing. The person who asked about time brought up a good point.
How to make histograms was confusing. Jeff told our group in the breakout room that we have to base the histogram off of bin width, not bin number. This wasn't clear in the modules or lecture. 
I feel like i have more questions regarding histograms but since I didnt have enough time to tinker with them in excel i couldnt get to ask them. Should I over prepare for classes?
 The different types of data keep confusing me, especially the difference between the numerical data.
 I thought that the choosing which graph to use part of class was confusing today. I am still confused about nominal vs ordinal and numerical vs categorical.
 The pdf that says what to do for A07 has confusing instructions for what to do with the histograms 
 I did not understand how exactly to set the correct bi  width and number in excel for mac. Everytime I place the calculated values, the ranges do not equal whole numbers.
 Nothing was overly confusing besides the conversation about if hourly data points are continuous or discrete.
 Assignment 7 is alittle confusing but I will be reading through it to understand it better. But working with the Excel graph was helpful 
 It would be nice if the announcements were on a separate presentation, and reposted on bright space in another tab under content. 
 I was confused by the choice of line graph for the in-class assignment. I thought a histogram was the obvious choice as it shows frequency and the question being asked was about low usage, which would be easily identified as a point with low frequency on a histogram. I think the line graph, on the other hand, would have been a better choice if the question was asking about a trend in time, such as: during which intervals of time is the usage increasing?
 Determining what type of data is what, like discrete, nominal, etc.
 I think most of my confusion around histograms was cleared up today but my confusion with excel is still pretty high. For example, I can't figure out how to order a set of data unless it's within a pivot table. Also, I'm having trouble making the differences between numerica continuous and numerical discrete data clear.
 Understanding how to specifically format parts of graphs(like the axes) in Excel is confusing. 
 One thing that confused me in todays class was how we would go about renaming the document we were supposed to submit for the in class activity. Another thing that confused me was in the in class activity and when we are supposed to submit it. Are we required to submit before exiting the breakout? 
 I thought the explanation of how each component of the histograms  are found to be somewhat confusing. 
 I am still a little bit unclear on how to work some of the aspects on excel including changing the axis value on a Mac. I would suggest a little bit longer on working through excel. Not necessary, though. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on how to adjust the histogram bin range and number of bins to get nice numbers for the axes.
 The process of creating a histogram on Mac. One of my teammate's struggled with this and I wasn't sure how to help.
 I did not find anything confusing, and did not need more details in anything.
 I am confused if you find your bin width to have a decimal in it, do you round that up or down to keep the graph nice with no decimals or do you just leave it. 
 Today's lesson was straightforward except the part about histograms and mac users.

I think the review of graphs was very interesting as it helped clarify the differences between them. I definitely used the wrong graphs for the previous assignments due today, but this class helped clarify the differences.
How to create a histogram.
I liked learning about finding out how to graph different variables. I also found how the histograms and the use of the statistics function useful.
What I found most interesting in today’s class was the implementation of examples to give students a more broad demonstration of histograms. I found it interesting how changing the type of data could completely change whether or not a certain graph was the better choice to use.","I enjoyed the studio time working with my group on our assignments. We got a lot done. 
I really like statistics so I love learning about data distribution and skew and what changes how a group of data presents itself. 
Using excel learning histograms
The part I found most interesting in today’s class was how well histograms display the distribution of data. 
The web chart explaining what charts we can use in excel depending on what information we have been given.
It was interesting in today’s class to learn about how to create histograms in excel and how to format them properly.
Difference between the graphs

I found the advice on how to do the activity incredibly helpful. My team was wrongly doing the activity, and without the clarification likely would have turned it in without meeting the requirements. -> 3
It was interesting to see how going over the pros and cons for an idea can change designs. -> 3
I enjoyed the idea of the in class activity despite the poor topic. It was good practice in determining pros and cons. -> 3
I liked the evaluation of pros/cons of the costumer service. I think maybe you could give us questions to think about if we need to further evaluate pros/cons for any project -> 4
I found our discussion of pros and cons very interesting today, especially when it came to how they related to engineering -> 3
This whole design project really appeals to me and I’m excited to draw out the sketches for my group. -> 4
Going over what we should do in assignment 17 was extremely helpful to my team. We would have done the assignment incorrectly if we hadn’t gone over the assignment expectations in class. -> 5
Not many things happened today, I did like the in class activity which made me think outside the box. -> 2
I found the thought experiments very interesting because they will be very useful when thinking about the ideas we generate for A17. -> 3
I enjoyed coming up with ideas and thought it was interesting to see how my teamates thoughts varied. -> 3

reflections: I found the use of functions in Matlab to be the most interesting part of the class. It was helpful to learn how to create and use functions to simplify and streamline my code. The in-class activities using functions were also very informative and engaging. Overall, I feel much more confident in my ability to use functions in Matlab after taking this class."

Not using loops and instead using element by element functions
I liked that there was lots of studio time to work on assignments. I liked working on the order of operations.
I found using the logical functions interesting
Being able to see what we learned in the pre class videos in action
The most interesting thing was learning about logical function with 0 and 1
ICA
i like using the rational functions. i know what they mean and they are easy to use. greater than, less than. simple stuff.
The logical operators and the example of the door access logic system.
find functions!

More explanation on whet variance means exactly
The most confusing part was to adjust our data with the correct decimal places.
The significant figures were a little confusing during the in class activities.
Nothing as of now
Maybe could have elaborated more on variance
Most of the concepts were in the preclass videos so the content was not confusing.
Today's lecture was pretty straightforward, I did not feel as thought I was confused on the material and did not have any questions that needed answering
There was nothing that was confusing at all today.","Nothing was confusing in class today. I understood the slides and what was to be completed for out ICA.
Nothing 
The assignment due next week 
Everything was clear
i think everything was clearly explained. 
i was a little lost about the shortcut keys in excel. 
Nothing was really confusing or needed more details. 
Assignment deadlines 
nothing, it was really good

 What the purpose of the survey was.
 The topics today were explained nicely and I did not find anything very confusing. 
 I am confused on what the A03 assignment really entails.
 Everything was good. More clarity for AO3
 Just figuring out when to apply sig figs.
 I wasn't able to understand the question asked related to people and mean, median, and mode. I don't know if it is asking us the preference of being a mean, median, mode, or else.

They were also confused by what type of graphs to use. Students also would want some more clarification on their assignment. Students were confused by A04 submissions. Students were also confused by excel especially formatting a table on excel and making boxes bigger. Students seemed worried about quiz 1.,"I have never used course grade before so I was kind of unsure how to turn in my practice quiz. I got it figured out though. |_| Although it was part of the quiz deciding which type of graph to use was confusing today. |_| Everything we did in class wasn't confusing this time. However, I felt that I have to master how to do every skill that the quiz 1 is going to ask. |_| Just finding where the practice quiz was |_| It would be nice to name some more clarification on what to do for the assignment.","quiz/quiz 1

I thought it was interesting to learn about compile speeds.
Suppressing is more efficient.
I thought learning how to time and see the times to run functions to be cool
The A11 part 2 the instructions are way more straight forward
I thought that it was interesting that you can have a loop inside of a loop inside of a loop etc. I just think that is cool because you can run a condition completely before you go on to the primary condition.
writing the for loops out on the board helped me see what was happening
The most interesting thing in class was performing in class activity as it needed a little brain and teamwork.
I liked the chart we drew and seeing how the nested loops worked. It was neat how the interact and the things you can do with them
I found it interesting that there are times when no loop is faster than loop.
How you can do some calculations faster than others
The in class activity was pretty enlightening and I wish every other ICAs were like that. It is conceptual and pretty important to know if one wants to learn coding.

A06
N/A
I found learning about the different ways to find functions interesting 
Doing the MATLAB commands
How you can mix all the logical operators
I liked the group work with classmates on the in class activity.
I found the logical arrays the most interesting. It opens up lots of possibilities
Short Circuiting 
 The most interesting was applying the different logical functions to create arrays or find the values.
 Binary numbers
 I enjoyed working with the small groups to help solve questions that were on the slide.
 Relational operators
 Getting more info about plotting was helpful
 I liked the logic functions
 The application of the logical operators
 The most interesting aspect was the logical arrays and how they open up more possibilities in analyzing data. 
 The most interesting part was A06 where we applied the functions that we learned. 
 most interesting was working with logical operators.
 Although it was confusing, the idea of combing several functions into one command was interesting because it shortens up the entire code. This is helpful for later on. 
 It was interesting to see how we can use mathematical terms in matlab.
 Creating logical relations to get results
 The automatization that can be done
 I enjoyed plotting data in my A06 assignment. Customizing the legend and the color of the data was enjoyable.
 The last in class exercise was fun figuring out the correct code to use for the problems.
 I thought the plotting discussion was interesting. It helped clear up some of the things I was confused about last time. 
 Many different ways to do the same problem 
 Once I understood these formulas I was interested in how they work because I was surprised that you could sum the numbers of true statements by using find and sum.
 I was engaged by the active learning activities, as they required some thinking.
 While not necessarily interesting, I wanted to point attention towards the plot slide today. I thought the slide with all of the arrows and notes did a great job of explaining all the functions.
 Talking to my classmates!
 The assignment was interesting but difficult because I had to fully rely on external help
 It was very interesting that the logical functions could be combined and integrated several time in one function. 
 I found learning how to use relationship operations interesting

I enjoyed working on the team project and getting a chance to work ahead with my group. -> 3", ,,"I enjoyed working with my team in studio time today to work on assignment 10.
I really like statistics and I enjoyed using my calculator to input data and create formulas to represent data. I also did some research on the Taum Sauk reservoir which was fun.
What I found interesting about today’s class was how there are so many different models to depict a system. 
I found it interesting that Reservoirs can be so complex. And that so many different types of engineers are needed in order to create such a reservoir.
I thought the laminar approach to modeling was interesting as I had never heard of it before and it made a lot of sense to me.
I found the different ways that values can be approximated to be a cool challenge.
Modeling 
Going over simple examples of how to use the laminar approach 
I was making charts about the different relationships between volumes of the upper lower and total reservoirs and found their relationships interesting
It was interesting to see the way mathematical models can be used to represent many things.
 I found it interesting how we would need to use the vertical cross section in order to determine the change in the horizontal cross section.
 I found it interesting how we could fins the distance between the resvoirs 
 The ability to model anything mathematically 
 I found that calculating volume of complex shapes can be do e using the laminar method and a depth of 1 ft. 
 I found it very interesting that you are able to find an equation for perimeter that applies for both shapes without having to adjust for each.

 Its reallly hard to approximate taum sauks volume
 The taum sauk reservoir calculations were interesting because seeing how simple the calculation for power is is very cool.
 I really liked learning how we solve for P and how to represent something mathematically. 
 The class in all was very interesting
 Excel can be used to create this relationship between volume and water height in the reservoir. I also didn’t realize at first that you have to adjust your volume formula based on the slope when u go deeper. I was assuming that it was just a straight vertical line to the bottom.
 It was interesting that I can get estimate value of a stuff in real life with mathematical way.
 This class didn’t interest me too much. Just learning nee stuff seemed cool and was good to get in.

 I found the laminar approach to be the most confusing and the most interesting part of the lecture today. It’s like a three dimensional application of Riemann sums.
 How use it is to develop an equation to solve for/simply complex data or problems

The two men pulling on the rope tension. I understand why the answer was between 100N and 200N, but I wouldn’t have known how to find that on my own.
I think that today’s lesson was good, but I thought that the top hat question about finding the second force could’ve been elaborated on a little more because it was a little confusing for me.
Tension, multiple directions of tension
The math for me has always been confusing; however, it was explained thoroughly.
I found one of the clicker questions confusing. It was the one with the ship slowing down with the wrench inside.
The part that I found confusing was the conceptual questions on top hat because I didn’t understand why the wrench was moving the way it was.
I thought applying Newton’s laws were a bit confusing
I feel like the tension problem at the very end was confusing and I wanted to do more tension problems to fully understand it
The direction of the vectors in the problem we solved in groups
Elevator moving up and down and determine the force when it is moving different ways
The problem with the two people pulling on the rope was a little confusing to me.
I was confused on how to find the different components with forces involved.
The formulas to find the missing force in the top hat question
Tension was very confusing in today’s lecture
Nothing about the lecture was confusing today. All the problems were discussed thoroughly, and most of the time the wrong answers were debunked throughout the lecture. If something was at all confusing, I would’ve liked to spend a bit more time on inertial reference frames.
Understanding how the wrench appears to be moving differently relative to other objects. I think I’m overthinking what the weird relative really means.
The salami and tension forces in ropes are still somewhat confusing to envision
How to solve for a negative fnet. It is confusing because I don’t always know what determines the positive vs negative direction.
The question that contains two forces.
In today’s lecture, the beginning of the lecture was confusing. Newton’s first laws with the wrench was difficult for the first two questions.
How inertial reference frames interact with objects inside and outside
What was confusing for me today was the tug of war problem.  I was not sure about how it worked.  Although the explanation allowed me to understand it, i feel like i need more practice with types of problems like that.
I believe conceptualize question need a bit more explanation. They can be very tricky sometime, for example if you just change the wording I’ll just get confuse
I didn’t understand the Newton’s 2nd Law problems. I needed more explanation as to way objects appeared based on what they were relative .
The top hat problem we did involving one of Newton’s laws
I was struggling to understand the intertidal vs. noninertial situations.
I think I understood most of the lecture today. I think the hardest part conceptually was probably the tension force. I kinda got the last question wrong when the forces were different in each direction, but after he explained it I understood the problem much better.
normal forces
I didn’t really find anything confusing. I think tension could have been talked about a little more. I was still slightly confused about the explanation. The salami question was a little weird. Otherwise the lecture was good.
N3LP’s could have used some additional examples to explain its relevance in problems.
Nothing was confusing really. I would have liked more practice problems rather than conceptual.
Nothing
I understood the lecture content very clearly today. However, the information about Newton’s second law was a bit confusing. I got a wrong answer in the problem, but I set up my equation wrong. I thought the net force was zero and I could set the two forces equal to each other.
I could use some more detail pertaining to phantom forces. I felt professor Nero explained it throughly I just wanted to know if I should study this concept for the exams.
I could’ve used more questions like the one we did in groups
mass vs weight
I was confused by the tension problems. It was difficult to understand why the tensions don’t add.
interial reference frames
The rope pulling example with tension
inertial reference frames were very confusing and poorly explained
I was a little bit confused with inertial reference frames and how inertial frames compare to non inertial frames
I am unclear as to how tension relates to Newton’s third law.
I would like further explanation of the tug of war tension problem and why the force of tension was between 2 values.
The concept of inertial frames was confusing because I didn’t understand why the wrench would appear to be accelerating forward but then i thought about what happens in a car and I got it.
Relative motion with moving reference points and how phantom forces affect relative motion
I was having trouble understanding some of the newtons’s first law problems because i didnt understand the position of the alien relative to the ship or the wrench or know if that matters
Inertial and noninertial because it’s a little hard to picture the phantom forces relative to a person standing still.
There could have been more explanation connecting Newton’s Laws to the equations.
Today’s lecture was not confusing. Dr. Nero explained Newton’s Three Laws of Motion in a way that was informative and easy to understand.
How to solve for different forces in the x and y direction with actual numbers
I think that the word descriptions of the Laws should be states more clearly because most of us learned and memorized them as “sum of the forces” or “objects in motion stay in motion”.
Drawing free body diagrams. For the more complex problems I struggle labeling all the forces in the right directions
I was confused by the question involving the 2 blocks in free fall and how there is no normal force between them.
I always struggled with Newton’s second law. Hence I find it confusing when writing Newton’s second law equations in order to solve for specific forces. I also struggle with Tension and understanding which direction it is acting in.
inertial with the car - would like more explains of this.
I get confused on free body diagrams, especially blocks on ramps. Also, why do you use cos(x) when calculating the y components of a force?
I would have like to see more about the mathematics combined with the conceptual instead of just segregating both to one another.
projectile motion is still confusing
I was a little confused by the tension forces, specially figuring out which direction they go in, since the diagram showed the forces going toward each other.","Tension forces

The dinosaur example was confusing. The explanation at the end made sense, but I think we could’ve used another example to help clarify. -> 3

In today’s lecture the only thing that was confusing was the effects of constant speed on acceleration. -> 3
There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don’t remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. -> 3

Honestly I thought today’s lecture was very straight forward and I wasn’t confused that much -> 1
average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me -> 2
The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could’ve been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could’ve done a few more practice problems about different “topics.” -> 2
The confusing part of today’s lecture was the problem about the dinosaurs accelerating at different rates. I didn’t understand how to develop the two equations. However, after learning how to solve it, it didn’t seem that bad. -> 3
The last quadratic equation was slightly confusing with having to evaluate the equation and pick the correct answer. -> 1
The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer. -> 3
I was still very confused on the right hand rule. I still have trouble understanding it. I, also, didn’t understand the  i and j values, but they made more sense after this lecture. -> 2

I didn’t understand the circular motion aspect of today’s lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday. -> 2

I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use. -> 2
Circular motion and how acceleration works with it. -> 3
the question we had to answer in breakout rooms was confusing at first, but became simpler when explained -> 3
The thing that confused me about the lecture was how clockwise, and counter clockwise are not vectors. However when you said vectors can’t be curved, I realized that rotating vector wouldn’t be able to work. -> 2
During the dinosaur example problem, I was confused on how adding their accelerations still resulted in the right answer. -> 2
The concept of keeping what negative or positive was a bit confusing -> 1
The second last question was a bit confusing but Dr. Nero explained it perfectly -> 3

The first question with the two Dinos was very confusing at first but once my group knew how to use the displacement we were fine. -> 3

Circular motion/acceleration was probably most confusing. I also had difficulty with examples about going back and forth between acceleration, velocity, and position. -> 3

We could maybe look at other ways to solve the dinosaur question. I know some people in my group used calculus for it, but potentially other kinematics and substitutions. (Although these would probably take longer) -> 1
Using quadratic equation; just not used to using it for physics -> 2
In the Physics class at my high school we used different variable in the kinematic equations. -> 1
nothing, it all made sense, but I took physics in high school so I already knew the concepts. -> 1

I was a little confused by the vector that starts at the origin and ends on the curve. -> 1

This lecture was very well taught. I really like that you showed us an exam question. It's hard to find good ones online to do practice with. It would be awesome if you could show us more exam questions. Maybe give a little more time to do them however.
I thought that the last question was confusing
The problems were pretty difficult in terms of understanding the fbds and what is happening to the system and i wish there was more time given overall even for the conceptual questions
The final exam we did in class was slightly confusing. How to find the acceleration was the only part I needed more clarification on.
i was confused on the final problem and how to make a diagram for both systems
The last question regarding two objects, and one moving on top of the other. I didn't understand why F-fs = m2*a ? I had thought F-fs = 0...even though I first did equal it to m2*a
I think the last top hat question involving the two blocks should have more explanation in the solution
The last problem we did with the two masses was confusing because I did not know how to include the second block of ice into the problem.
The final example with the two blocks sliding on ice had a confusing set up
The two blocks with the ice and friction between them
Pushing down increasing normal force
Why the coëfficiënt of friction is unit less and how does that work?
do we have to always found up when solving for fsmax that way it is the force overcoming friction?
The hardest thing to know is which type of friction to use.
Telling the difference between fs and fsmax can be confusing.
The difference between kinetic and static friction was difficult to understand in regards to real world examples. In high school I remember learning something about sneakers and the ground while running and tires on the roads.
What is the purpose of fs,max rather than just saying fs
The explanation of cold welds could have been more detailed in relation to friction.
I would like more details on how to reliably make equivalent problems/diagrams that are easier to solve.
The graph of static and kinetic friction had a steep drop off that occurring immediately.","Friction on an incline was what confused me. When more than one or two forces are applied, I feel like things are bound to get confusing. 
I found the top hat question about the two blocks hanging from the pulley the most confusing just because I understood it when I set the tensions equal to each other but not conceptually 
stacked bodys
Figuring out all the different forces that go with boxes next to each other together 
Everything was clear, just the problem with the bottom block accelerating was hard
I didn't find any of the material confusing or unclear, good lecture today
The last example with two blocks and one sliding on the other was confusing 
I was confused by the question with the two blocks where the bottom block had no friction. 
Sometimes finding the force needed to move a block, but this was typically for more complicated problems.
block on block
 Two top hat problems: the pirate and the last one with the 2 blocks stacked. I thought we went through the pirate one a little too fast, and for the last one, we ran out of time because class was ending. 
 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today's lecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
 The thing that was confusing about today's lecture was he conceptual question about the different between push and pull in terms of force.
 Top hat question with pulling being easier and not equal to pushing 
 I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
 The two blocks on a frictionless surface was very confusing
 It was confusing to solve the problem with the friction block on the frictionless block.
 The last top hat question was the most confusing, with the two different masses and the friction between them. 
 I wasn't confused by anything this lecture. I was really good at force problems in high school and the interactive lectures really boost my confidence. 
 The last question we ran out of time
 I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
 The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
 The idea of doing an example not being on a wedge was a little rough. Almost everything we have done so far is on a slope.
 Everything was clear, I just feel like I need more practice on friction
 I was confused how to determine the new force using friction and an angle. 
 How the acceleration without friction can be used to find an equation of friction with acceleration
 I think that everything was covered it pretty good detail. The only thing I was slightly confused about was the last example problem, but we ran out of time at the end of the class which I think is why I was confused. 
 I was confused about what the coefficient of friction was at first but you offered a good explanation and I understand now that it's not a constant and depends on the toughness of an object.
 I did not find today's lecture confusing, but I would like to learn more about what factors determine the coefficient of friction.
 I tend to need more explanation on how formulas are rearranged and why certain forces are placed where. 
 I get confused when to use equations.  Is there a formula sheet anywhere?
 The last problem was the most confusing for me. 
 the friction over more than one block on another
 I had difficulty understanding the second to last problem that we did with the 2 boxes on top of each other, the bottom box having a coefficient of friction equal to zero with the ground.
 I am confused on the problem with the two blocks on a frictionless surface. I don't get how we combined the two free body diagrams.
 i would like more examples where you split the problem into two systems. that helps me
 Friction of one object on top of another 
 Having two blocks on top of each other with friction and determining force
 The last problem, in particular creating the equation the go to the answer 
 The thing that I found confusing in today's lecture was the last problem with the two blocks. I was unsure of how to approach it because of the free body diagrams.
 Practice problem in class about force needed to push a block onto of another block
 How to calculate the force needed to pull a block off of another block

 The graph of static and kinetic friction had a steep drop off that occurring immediately. ","Most students had issues with the last problem, the one involving two blocks. There seemed to be some concern about timing, but also setting up the free body diagrams, as well as what forces of friction were working on the system. Principles of friction seemed to confuse many students, but perhaps they will get more practice in homeworks or in-class activities. There were a few students that also called out problems that they had  with ""push vs. pull"" systems.","I found the top hat question about the two blocks hanging from the pulley the most confusing just because I understood it when I set the tensions equal to each other but not conceptually  |_|  I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today'slecture.

 the first top hat question, why does is decrease 
 I was a bit confused about changes in interferences when the slit was made bigger or smaller. I think I was confused about the two slit experiment overall. 
 I was confused on how we came to the conclusion that the second question was decreasing. It logically made sense to me that it would be increasing. 
 I was confused by the relationship between wavelength and the speed of light.
 Why the strobelight creates a freezing effect on the light inside
 double slit experiment 
 I think the question about fringe spacing was a bit confusing, as I got confused by which equation to use.
 The conceptual top hat questions 
 How colors play a role with frequency.
 I found the the difference between double slit and normal to be confusing because thye use the same equations or something. 
 How to find minimum frequency needed to produce total destructive interference 
 Is light behaves like a wave with interference, what are photons? 
 Little bit confusing on critical angle. More example needed
 How do we determine the what theta should be to find how many time to get the number of maxima are reached like in the last example that was confusing
 I thought the fiber optic calculations were very confusing
 Double slit experiment
 I could use clarification on the last question we worked on on the two radio sources. I was a bit confused on what maxima meant in this context, and I was also unsure as to what the detected maxima would mean for the radio towers. Are those the places at which the signal would be strongest? I also think the conceptual rational behind the increase of decrease of the spacing between the fringes was confusing.

Why does there need to be a charge in order for the spark to occur when it is already charged?
I found that the most confusing thing was the work aspect of electric potential. I needed more elaboration on work by the system versus work on the system and how to define positive and negative for each.
I am still confused about why the equipotentials of two identical charges looks the way it does
Why is kq/r equal to voltage?
I was kind of confused on how the electric field flows through the cylinder with the two metal conducting plates.","Nothing
The first tophat question about the direction of the work done from point a to point b made sense with the explanation but I am still unsure about how this would work with different types of forces.
what exactly is an equipotential
the two metal balls

Why the external force from question 1 was a conservative force 
The mechanism of the 2nd experiment and the difference between the direction of an external force and the direction of electric force in the second top hat question 
I don't think i am confusing with anything.
The top hat question involving equipotentials around two positive charges was a bit confusing to me. 
The work done to bring two positive charges together question 
Relationship of work, electric potential, potential energy, and electric field
 why equipotentials of two charges can cross
 I don't understand what we take as the initial potential energy 
 The integration was a bit confusing and how to set up accordingly based on the problem 
 Not much, I liked your analogy between falling off a cliff and falling from a lot of volts. Maybe setting up the integral for the main problem today that had epsilon in it
 Not much was confusing. If I had to choose though I would say that calculating potential from a field was confusing.
 How to tell if work is positive or negative 
 The question about volts 
 Integration to find voltage.
 I was confused on how we could determine if work is positive or negative. Comparing it to energy and looking at the picture confused me when determining sign.
 the first top hat question about positive and negative work 
 Electric potential vs. potential of a system
 Why no work is done while moving along equipotentials was confusing because the particle is still moving. 
 The equipotential / voltage demo from class: you said that because we were along a singular equipotential that we could not feel the voltage, which would make sense, but what happens if we were to walk from one equipotential to another or if we held hands in a chain down the aisle crossing multiple equipotentials ?
 The last problem where we had to calculate the volts
 The concept of equipotential and its relation to work and potential energy was confusing, particularly the example where various voltages could be summed to find the net voltage.
 I was confused by why the work done by an external force is negative. Is this always the case when it goes against repulsion?
 I really could use more help on the math of equipotential
 Why did you integrate from 0 instead of infinity for the equipotential length?
 everything was clear. I understood about electric potential and how it is a scalar value. I was interesting to calculate the potential by simply using superposition.
 The lecture is good but need more examples will be great
 the equipotentials
 The fact that electric potential is not based on vectors or direction was pretty confusing. In the top hat question that involved multiple charges this part was confusing.

The right hand rule was a bit confusing pertaining to if you can use any finger and find the missing force","The direction of the force on the electrons in the first question 
Direction of current for cross product when not blatantly specified 
How to use right hand rule
How do you know when the electric force is equal to the magnetic force? I know you said when it is at equilibrium they are equal, but how do you know when it is at equilibrium?
Why you can put charge as e for the strip
cross product
Putting the four building blocks together for use in a problem 
I thought that the purpose of the circle demonstration was confusing. I think that the purpose of the equations in the videos were also confusing.
the right hand rule was confusing. I could use more direction in how to solve for the different components. 
Why was the velocity positive in the one clicker question when we used the equation that electric field = -voltage/width?
 Knowing which way to solve each problem was kind of confusing. The table you made at the beginning of class did help a lot however.
 The final word problem
 why the right hand rule is opposite for the electrons on the piece of metal
 I am not quite sure on how electrons impact the right hand rule. If you are measuring the direction of electrons in a wire with a magnetic field, would it be opposite to that of protons in a wire?
 whether or not the electric force is always equal to the magnetic force
 Today I was a little bit confused on getting started on some of the problems since they all have a slightly different formula/answer. I could use a few more practice problems using this method.
 Finding acceleration due to magnetic force 
 How do you know which direction to cross the length or current with in the torque problems because the current is going different directions. 
 I was a bit confused about how to incorporate all of the different equations that we were given. I struggled when trying to solve some of the problems in class. 
 The negative sign in the equation for electric field using voltage and distance 
 I was confused how the magnetic field could move the wire when electrons do not move very fast at all. And with the combined weight of the electrons would not have enough mass to move the wire.
 I was confused as to how we were supposed to utilize all of the equations from the videos., in conjunction, to formulate a new equation to fit the specific problem. It was difficult because I kept looking at the equation that I got from the video, so it was difficult making a new one off of that.
 What was confusing was figuring out how to get an equation from the four main ideas presented in class. 
 I am still confused by the right hand rule problem we had where the answer choices were right or left - I kept getting in or out for some reason.
 There was not many confusing things in class. I feel like I had a good understanding in class today. The only thing I felt unclear about was understanding when to flip the direction of the force vector.
 Where does the magnetic force act on a wire segment? From the center? How might we calculate the components of torque for a triangle loop for example?
 Vectors can be very confusing at times

 I was not sure how to solve the open ended top hah question
 Determining the direction in which magnetic force would point was slightly confusing.
 How electric force and magnetic force work together/at the same time
 I was still a bit confused about which vectors corresponded to which fingers in the right hand rule. 
 Finding equations and when to set them equal
 I think I still need more details on the hand rules.
 The examples are weird
 I don't understand the applications, as well as how the forces act. 
 Some of the questions in class where you combined multiple equations/ differentiating b/t multiple equations
 I was confused on how many different ways in which you can combine the building blocks for applying magnetic force. Can any number of them be present in a problem? On an exam how many building blocks would we be expected to combine? For the last example problem I was confused as to how there could be a torque when the net force is zero, but I think I reasoned that out.
 I was confused on the right hand rule and could use another explanation. 
 The direction of magnetic force 
 The very last top hat question 
 learning about the hall effect was quite difficult, as I did not understand when we use its particular equation.

 I found the two poles with different centers of mass very interesting. I tried them out after class and it was really cool seeing how the center of mass affected the inertia.
 I found the demonstrations of moment of inertia were very interesting because I was able to visualize it more clearly. Also because they demonstrated a concept that is counter intuitive to me.

I thought the idea of polarization is a little confusing. I think I have trouble with determining what the angle should be and how it is affected by a change in material. -> 3", ,,"The problem with the 1.2 m rod over water
Understanding which is n1 and n2 as well as using trig to calculate refraction angles
how solving for the right triangle solved the side lengths
I found which the direction the light refracted through a material to be confusing because it is hard to remember that greater indexes bend backwards. 
The exam grades
the third tophat question
The open ended problem
When to determine which angle to use for light.
I was confused how the different angles worked in related to the n values 
The first tophat regarding the comparison of the three refractions was confusing. I was unable to tell which one had a higher n value based on the image
 stuff on refraction
 Trigonometry review. Finding angles, similar triangles, etc.
 Today I was at first confused on the first question but as I practiced drawing more normal lines it became more clear.
 The tophat with the sunlight and pole was very confusing
 I was pretty confused on refraction, and seeing through the water in the ocean.
 The concept of photons was a little confusing for me. Could you possibly explain what photons are and their responsibility in a wave?
 The circumstances under which total internal reflection occurs
 When we were doing the problem about which n was greater I was confused how the order was a,b,c. 
 Which layer would hold light problem
 the example with the pole and the pool of water 
 I found the tophat questions with all the angles and trig confusing. I understand it fundamentally but I think I need to work it out myself slower.
 The calculations problem 
 Polarizers
 I was confused by the trigonometry for calculating the shadow in the Top Hat calculation. Where did the 30 degrees come from?
 It was confusing calculating the open ended question. 
 The refraction problem
 Why the line for the difference in indexes in the water problem is vertical instead of horizontal 
 Conceptually how refraction works.
 The whole lesson in general was confusing to me. 
 index of refraction
 The refraction problem with the layers 
  The idea behind the law of refraction was slightly confusing. Specifically the example with the fish and finding the radius of the circle through which light passes was confusing.
 What I found most confusing was light refracting off of multiple surfaces. 
 Determining the direction at which light will be reflected or refracting is confusing. Like the first couple questions on top hat of determining which refraction indexes were bigger from just looking at the light rays.
 The shadow tophat question
 In the fish example, why can the fish see the person outside the circle?
 The indexing gave me trouble 
 Solving and knowing which angle went with n for snells law was confusing. I was confused on the way the equation worked.
 I was confused about a lot of the light problems and examples
 The light intensity is little bit confused. 
 Refraction
 I am a bit confused as to how adding a polarizer that has an angle in between the angles of two other polarizers canceling each other out allows light through. 
 Why does the intensity of unpolrized light half when sent through the first polarizer?
 The light of reflection and refraction was a bit confusing and I think I just need more time and easier examples 
 I understood refraction and total internal reflection, but felt confused about the length calculation.
 I need more details or related to the practice problem.
