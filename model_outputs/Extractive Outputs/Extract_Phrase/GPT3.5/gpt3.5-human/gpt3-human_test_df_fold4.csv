The most interesting I learned in class today was that various companies in the past tried to name themselves to be at the top of the alphabet.
I liked the activity in the beginning of class, it really showed how structure can have a big impact on time effciency. 
It was very interesting of how function relates to structure so absolutely.
What I found most interesting was how search filters worked because we all use google so much and it it uses trees possibly to execute those searches
The top hat section where we looked for names in the phone book. The last few slides were also pretty interesting. I liked how they were real life examples. 
 I felt that the relation of structure and function to everyday objects was the most interesting.  I also felt that the activity involving the searches at the beginning of class was entertaining.
 How sometimes recursion is better or worse than iteration
 How things are sorted is interesting 
 I liked the interactive activity with finding the phone numbers of people. It was interesting to see how much structure impacts our life.
 I found how different structures can vastly affect how you can find (or not find) things in a data structure interesting!
 I found the fibonacci sequence example interesting, and I liked the jokes in todays class
 Prefix trees, because it was a new concept and gave me a new way to think about lists of data
 I found structure itself interesting. The phone book example and hammers made it super evident what structure was.
 Data structures and algorithms are always interesting. 
 I found that learning about how everything has structure and purpose in terms of the way they are designed was interesting. More specifically the example about categorizing football players positions based on height and weight.
 The real world example for structure and function: hammers, football players. Those make us better understand","In this lecture, students found the description of structure and function interesting.

Today was our first lecture, and it served as more of an introductory lecture. The class had a welcoming vibe, and the professor seemed nice. He spoke in a very clear manner and was audible throughout the lecture. He frequently asked the class for questions and made sure to answer the questions effectively and thoroughly. He constantly monitored the zoom meeting while attending to the students in the classroom. Overall, great lecture.
I thought that today's class was very informative and wasn't really too confusing at all. The Research projects and teams were explained well and very interesting to learn about.

41,52,52,Alex,engr131_s014-fall2020,1,Describe what you found most confusing in today’s class,"I didn’t find the class today confusing. Everything was explained specifically and helpfully. I found the class to be interactive and helped me to understand what will be required to succeed in the class. -> 1
Everything was clear in today’s lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well. -> 1
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. -> 1
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. -> 2
I didn’t understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group. -> 2
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class. -> 1
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn’t anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. -> 1
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction -> 2
Overall today’s class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward. -> 1
They was a lot of information thrown, I would’ve liked a calendar with when all the homework’s and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. -> 2
The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR. -> 3
I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”. -> 2
The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. -> 2
When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students. -> 1
What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing? -> 2
Everything seemed clear to me -> 1
Nothing -> 1
There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class. -> 1
I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It’s not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course. -> 2
i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. -> 3
The way assignments on brightspace are organized. -> 2
Today’s class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I’m assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. -> 1
I did not find anything confusing in today’s class. Today’s class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester. -> 1
I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today’s class. -> 1
I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I’m a little confused about is assignment A3. I’m not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I’ll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. -> 1
Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them. -> 1
Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project? -> 2
I’m still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class? -> 2
Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward. -> 1
I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. -> 3
There wasn’t much that I found confusing or unclear in today’s class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. -> 1
The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! -> 2
In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it’s recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting? -> 1
Everything was clear. However, I’m somewhat unsure about what the assignment is for CATME on Friday -> 1
 N/A -> 1
I think that everything is pretty clear, especially because the slides will be posted and all of the information is on there. The slides also have additional contact information if you need more help. -> 1
I thought everything that was explained in this lecture was very clear. I became a little confused when we started to draw a scene in our notebooks. I understand eventually what was going on and the rest of the lecture was very clear. -> 1
There were no confusing things in the lecture. -> 1
Today’s class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand so I didn’t really notice anything confusing during the class. There wasn’t a whole lot to be confused about. -> 1
I wanted to know more about what we were exactly going to be doing in the first project and when exactly our groups were going to be decided. -> 3
It was all pretty clear! -> 1
I thought the most confusing part was how to navigate brightspace and see when assignments are due. Overall, though, it was pretty clear and easy to follow. -> 2
Everything was explained thoroughly. Given the introductory nature of today’s lecture, there is nothing that was particularly confusing or unclear. -> 1
Maybe more details in the CATME assignments. -> 1
There wasn’t anything confusing that we discussed in today’s class. Everything was described in detail and easy to understand. -> 1
I found nothing in today's class that was confusing. -> 1
Will be in the same discussion group throughout the whole course or will the groups change from assignment to assignment. -> 1
The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time. -> 3
Nothing was confusing to me. The lecture reviewed the syllabus, which I had already read. -> 1
It was a really good first class, unfortunately I am still somewhat confused on the weekly class schedule and the upcoming bike project. -> 2
I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually. In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester? -> 3
When will we be starting the first project? Will it start on Friday and do we have work specifically for the project that’s due before class 1B? -> 1
So far I felt that everything in today’s class was pretty easy to understand mainly because it was just an introduction day. I also have already navigated bright space so I know my way around the system. -> 1
I think I understood everything from the class pretty well. I think the class was well formatted. -> 2
I think all the topics that I was wondering about were covered in the zoom call. I now know what to do for hw and in the future. -> 1","I didn’t find the class today confusing.

Today's class was pretty straightforward and easy to understand so I didn't really notice anything confusing during the class. There wasn't a whole lot to be confused about. -> 1
I wanted to know more about what we were exactly going to be doing in the first project and when exactly our groups were going to be decided. -> 3
It was all pretty clear! -> 1
I thought the most confusing part was how to navigate brightspace and see when assignments are due. Overall, though, it was pretty clear and easy to follow. -> 2
Everything was explained thoroughly. Given the introductory nature of today's lecture, there is nothing that was particularly confusing or unclear. -> 1
Maybe more details in the CATME assignments. -> 1
There wasn't anything confusing that we discussed in today's class. Everything was described in detail and easy to understand. -> 1
I found nothing in today's class that was confusing. -> 1
Will be in the same discussion group throughout the whole course or will the groups change from assignment to assignment. -> 1
The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time. -> 3
Nothing was confusing to me. The lecture reviewed the syllabus, which I had already read. -> 1
It was a really good first class, unfortunately I am still somewhat confused on the weekly class schedule and the upcoming bike project. -> 2
I would like more details in terms of how we will take tests virtually. In addition, will we have the same team for the whole semester? -> 3
When will we be starting the first project? Will it start on Friday and do we have work specifically for the project that's due before class 1B? -> 1
So far I felt that everything in today's class was pretty easy to understand mainly because it was just an introduction day. I also have already navigated bright space so I know my way around the system. -> 1
I think I understood everything from the class pretty well. I think the class was well formatted. -> 2
I think all the topics that I was wondering about were covered in the zoom call. I now know what to do for hw and in the future. -> 1","I didn't find the class today confusing.

Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well. -> 1
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely. -> 1
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved. -> 1
I didn't understand if that was the group we would be with for the rest of the year or if we would be in a different group. -> 2
Overall, the presentation was easy to follow and I gained a good grasp of what the class entails.  I would say the only confusing part was what work we needed to get done for the next class. -> 4
I think that the call was very smooth, and the breakout sessions made sense. There really wasn't anything that I found terribly confusing. The only thing I can think of would be how the different projects and quizzes will work, but other than that, I feel it went very well. -> 1
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction -> 4
Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward. -> 1
They was a lot of information thrown, I would've liked a calendar with when all the homework's and quizzes are due instead of having to click specifically on each week and looking at the modules. -> 2
The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR. -> 2
I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”. -> 4
The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class. -> 2
When we go into the breakout rooms, some people do not know remember what to do, or for the in class activity, there were some questions, so if more directions or reminders were put into the chat, it might help those students. -> 2
What exactly is that bike project? What will we be doing? -> 2
Everything seemed clear to me -> 1
Nothing -> 1
There was nothing confusing or unclear on today's class. -> 1
I never really got why we did the drawing of the “engineer in 2030.” It seemed like busywork more or less. It's not a bad thing but I feel like we could have gone over a little more about the course. -> 4
i was a little confused on what assignments are due when and if there is an overall due-date calendar. -> 2
The way assignments on brightspace are organized. -> 2
Today's class was fairly clear. The only topic I could have had more details on was how the Bike Share project will work, but I'm assuming that will be covered in the next lecture. -> 1
I did not find anything confusing in today's class. Today's class was very helpful and helped me understand what will happen the rest of the semester. -> 1
I found nothing overly confusing or unclear in today's class. -> 1
I think everything was straight forward. The only thing I'm a little confused about is assignment A3. I'm not sure what it is but I will look on brightspace and see if I can find it. Otherwise I'll send an email. Other than that I understand everything. -> 1
Everything was straightforward and I understood the class dynamics , the Brightspace, and the Office 365. The breakouts were nice to talk to people about the class and get to know them. -> 1
Were the groups random or were they our teams for the bike project? -> 3
I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class? -> 2
Nothing was too confusing. As the introduction class, everything was clear and straightforward. -> 1
I was wondering if the CATME practice survey that we took before the Team Formation Survey was for a grade. -> 2
There wasn't much that I found confusing or unclear in today's class. The exact objectives of the drawing portion was a little confusing but I asked my classmates and figured it out. -> 1
The scheduling process for this class was a little confusing. With my other classes and all the different softwares that we need. Balancing these softwares can become extremely difficult, so one consolidated software would be nice. I am unsure if this will be brightspace/CATME, but I am hoping it will be brightspace.Thank you!!! -> 2
In class today, on the slides you said that we should be on Zoom for each class but then you recorded the Zoom meeting. I was just wondering why it's recorded if we are all supposed to be on the real time Zoom meeting? -> 4

43,67,67,Alex,engr131_s014-fall2020,4,Describe what you found most confusing in today’s class,"I wasn’t really confused about anything -> 1
It seems like the main goal of the bike share project, and especially the smaller assignments due next week, were all brushed over with minimal instruction. -> 3
I wish we went over the out-of-class stuff regarding the career selection in just a little clearer detail. It was just a lot all at once, so it got a bit confusing. -> 3
The amount of information given in the short amount of time for the next “section” (career exploration) was a little overwhelming and caused a little confusion in what should be done by when. -> 2
I thought that learning about the types of the charts was a bit confusing. The examples were pretty easy but then looking at the homework it seems more difficult. -> 3
Nothing confusing -> 1
Nothing was confusing, I fully understood the graphs in the slideshow as well as the excel graphing methods -> 1
The class was well explained it helpful as it gave helpful insight on what and when to look for in terms of Homework and Quizzes. -> 1
I thought today’s class was pretty straightforward and nothing was too confusing -> 2
Everything seem straight forward today. -> 1
Why we use line plots over scatter plots -> 2
The slides on the career exploration was a little confusing. -> 1
Thought class was good, I was a bit confused when we were going over the sign up sessions. -> 1
the different engineering videos we have to watch and when -> 2
It would be cool to use the raise hand tool to ask questions while in the slides, and that the participants tab is constantly being looked -> 3
Today’s class felt pretty straightforward.  Since the in-class assignment was relatively easy to finish you could have possibly made the breakout rooms for that part shorter. -> 1
Exactly where assignments need to be submitted was a little confusing, as well as the naming scheme for certain assignments. -> 1
It was a little hard to follow what you wanted ya to do for the engineering fields assignments only because there was a lot of information. But I’m sure that as we go though it ourselves we will understand -> 2

working with my team
I found that the amount of carbon that a car with “good gas mileage” was interesting because it seemed large.
I found the use of ethics in engineering interesting
The images of change website was very interesting with regards to how it included man made and natural changes in the environment.
I found my environmental footprint interesting.
Calculating our carbon footprints and finding out how many earths would be required if everyone lived like we did was very interesting.
I thought the footprint activity was really interesting to see how many earths I would need if everyone lived like me. I thought it was a really cool for everyone to see that so people could make changes to their daily lives!
I really liked the part of class where we were able to see what our carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions were.
I found the website that found my carbon footprint very interesting today.
The most interesting part of today’s class was using a website/survey to figure out your own carbon footprint. It was interesting learning how much damage we are each doing individually to our environment.  Hopefully through engineering we will reduce our carbon emissions.
I thought that the carbon footprint calculator was very interesting.
I found how engineers have to take ethics into consideration with things like climate change interesting. I also found the different slides showing glaciers and ice melting very interesting. The contrast was something I was not expecting in the pictures shown during class.
I found the many ways to view trade-offs and the different ethical points that need to be considered to be the most interesting part of today’s class.
The most interesting part of class was working through assignment 13 with my group.
I just enjoyed working on the solar project. My group had some problems to work out relating to the assignment, and those were enjoyable to solve.
Trade offs in design was interesting, and I like how we delved into climate impacts and calculated our own carbon footprints to see what our impct on the planet was.
I found the class activity the most interesting. This was because it involved our own lives with our own cars.
I found calculating our own carbon footprint interesting, as well as looking at the before and after pictures.
I enjoyed learning my car had a mpg of 24, I thought it was Better than that. Also the trade offs and the responsibilities of an engineer to protect the wellbeing of the community without saying “but it costs too much”.
looking at the climate change photos and assessing my own impact
I thought it was cool that we found our carbon footprint and that we also calculated what our car’s carbon footprint is. I also liked that we got so much time to work on the assignments, it really helps us to be on the same page with everything.
I found it interesting how well I did on the exam. I was really proud of my work.
I found interesting how large my carbon footprint is. I might play around with the website later.
I thought that the most interesting thing in today’s class was figuring out your carbon footprint. I did not know it before today and so thought it was nice to learn about.
I found the side by side photos of the glacier melts to be most interesting as they showed how impactful and important climate change really is. Whole biomes were destroyed by it already.
That if everyone was like me we would need 3.2 earths.
I enjoyed the discussion about our grades and the amount of time we had to work on assignment 13.
I found it interesting how hi my caribou footprint is.
I liked looking at the carbon footprint website today! It was really interesting!
The carbon footprint calculated that you had us complete in class

The time in break rooms was very helpful for getting some team work accomplished.
I found it interesting how many planets I would need
I found it very interesting that we got to find the amount of CO2 that our cars emit, it’s nice to know what impact we have on the environment
A13 and the environment pictures were very cool.
Climate change stuff was interesting, but I have heard it all before.

I thought that the time given to work on A13 was good!
i like talking to my teammates
I thought it was interesting how we could see how many planets it would take if everyone acted like me and lived like me.
I enjoyed the long amounts of time we had to work as a team on the assignment
I found the before and after pictures I retesting because they show how drastic the changes are.
Learning about Car Emissions
I thought the footprint website was interesting
Studio time
I found it interesting that people have such a large impact on the environment.
I found the in class activity about CO2 produced by cars was very interesting
Working on the solar panel project
It was interesting to learn about our carbon footprints
How fast we can get certain assignments completed
I found it interesting doing the environmental aspect of the project. It’s definitely one of the things that I am interested in when thinking about becoming an engineer.

I found the carbon emission of my car interesting. -> 3.0","Solar panel specs
I found the site that calculated how many earths we would need if everybody lived like me very interesting and I do not know how they calculated that.
I found our footprint to be most interesting because it is crazy to think that we use that much energy as an individual.
I found that it was interesting that my carbon footprint is much higher than I expected.
working with my team
I found that the amount of carbon that a car with “good gas mileage” was interesting because it seemed large.
I found the use of ethics in engineering interesting
The images of change website was very interesting with regards to how it included man made and natural changes in the environment.
I found my environmental footprint interesting.
Calculating our carbon footprints and finding out how many earths would be required if everyone lived like we did was very interesting.
I thought the footprint activity was really interesting to see how many earths I would need if everyone lived like me. I thought it was a really cool for everyone to see that so people could make changes to their daily lives!
I really liked the part of class where we were able to see what our carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions were.
I found the website that found my carbon footprint very interesting today.
The most interesting part of today's class was using a website/survey to figure out your own carbon footprint. It was interesting learning how much damage we are each doing individually to our environment.  Hopefully through engineering we will reduce our carbon emissions.
I thought that the carbon footprint calculator was very interesting.
I found how engineers have to take ethics into consideration with things like climate change interesting. I also found the different slides showing glaciers and ice melting very interesting. The contrast was something I was not expecting in the pictures shown during class.
I found the many ways to view trade-offs and the different ethical points that need to be considered to be the most interesting part of today's class.
The most interesting part of class was working through assignment 13 with my group.
I just enjoyed working on the solar project. My group had some problems to work out relating to the assignment, and those were enjoyable to solve.
Trade offs in design was interesting, and I like how we delved into climate impacts and calculated our own carbon footprints to see what our impct on the planet was.
I found the class activity the most interesting. This was because it involved our own lives with our own cars.
I found calculating our own carbon footprint interesting, as well as looking at the before and after pictures.
I enjoyed learning my car had a mpg of 24, I thought it was Better than that. Also the trade offs and the responsibilities of an engineer to protect the wellbeing of the community without saying “but it costs too much”.
looking at the climate change photos and assessing my own impact
I thought it was cool that we found our carbon footprint and that we also calculated what our car's carbon footprint is. I also liked that we got so much time to work on the assignments, it really helps us to be on the same page with everything.
I found it interesting how well I did on the exam. I was really proud of my work.
I found interesting how large my carbon footprint is. I might play around with the website later.
I thought that the most interesting thing in today's class was figuring out your carbon footprint. I did not know it before today and so thought it was nice to learn about.
I found the side by side photos of the glacier melts to be most interesting as they showed how impactful and important climate change really is. Whole biomes were destroyed by it already.
That if everyone was like me we would need 3.2 earths.
I enjoyed the discussion about our grades and the amount of time we had to work on assignment 13.
I found it interesting how hi my caribou footprint is.
I liked looking at the carbon footprint website today! It was really interesting!
The carbon footprint calculated that you had us complete in class
footprint calculator website

The time in break rooms was very helpful for getting some team work accomplished.
I found it interesting how many planets I would need
I found it very interesting that we got to find the amount of CO2 that our cars emit, it's nice to know what impact we have on the environment
A13 and the environment pictures were very cool.
Climate change stuff was interesting, but I have heard it all before.

Working on calculations with total solar panel cost
I thought that the time given to work on A13 was good!
i like talking to my teammates
I thought it was interesting how we could see how many planets it would take if everyone acted like me and lived like me.
I enjoyed the long amounts of time we had to work as a team on the assignment
I found the before and after pictures I retesting because they show how drastic the changes are.
Learning about Car Emissions
I thought the footprint website was interesting

I thought the project four was confusing -> 1
Nothing was confusing at all. -> 1
The problem statement that we wrote for the in class activity was confusing because I wasn’t sure at first what we were writing it about. It took a while for me to figure out it was about the assignment 16. -> 2
I was confused about the quiz over Module 32 because I checked before class and the quiz was not available until class started so I missed this assignment. -> 5
I was a little confused about where to pull the information required for the project but I ended up figuring it out. -> 1
I was confused by what needed to be i clouded in the problem statement at first. I originally thought we needed to find a problem already but that’s not true. -> 1
The most confusing part of class was figuring out who we were supposed to ask questions to. Since there is only 2 days until the assignment is due we are confused if we need responses from people or if we should generate them ourselves. -> 3
All good -> 5
The location of the assignment and the numbered steps of the assignment were confusing. -> 3
The part of A16 where we are tasked to come up with questions and responses is confusing because of the little amount of time we have to gain actual answers. -> 3
Exactly what we are supposed to do in order to research our residents and end users of the product -> 3
I was confused on what parts we had to complete on assignment 16. After talking to my team we were able to figure it out!! -> 3
Nothing is confusing today -> 1
The assignment 16 expectations were confusing because there were conflicting messages in different places in brightspace. This needed clarification. -> 5
problem scoping -> 3
Whether the assignment due for Friday was just the first three parts of the last three parts was confusing because different documents said different things -> 2

I wasn’t quite sure what coefficient of determination was but I think it was mentioned previously so I will try to find it and send Jeff an email if I can’t -> 2
The way we are going to come up with our solution doesn’t make too much sense. Are we actually going to make it or just make a recommendation. -> 4
how much we need to do for problem scoping -> 1
It was confusing as to what what due before class started because the Brightspace page is not always updated with the class slides or Things to do before class. -> 3

Nothing was confusing
I wasn’t quite sure what coefficient of determination was but I think it was mentioned previously so I will try to find it and send Jeff an email if I can’t
The way we are going to come up with our solution doesn’t make too much sense. Are we actually going to make it or just make a recommendation.
how much we need to do for problem scoping
It was confusing as to what what due before class started because the Brightspace page is not always updated with the class slides or Things to do before class.

I found nothing in the class confusing. If anything I was slightly confused as to what to put in one of the columns of the tables in assignment 16, but we figured it out.
I think everything was really clear I liked how you explained everything very well in class today. I appreciate it.
Nothing
The most confusing part was what we were required to do for assignment A16
There wasn't any confusing information given in this class
How do we get information from stakeholder, do we just email them or answer our own questions?

I was confused about the document and the specific tasks we needed to complete by next class
I felt that most things in today's class were very straightforward and culminates the main points we went over this semester.
Everything is pretty clear
I did not understand what the project wanted until the TA came and explained
The open endedness of A16 was confusing
what assignment 16 is and where to get our information
The instructions of the project and what our task is was confusing
Nothing was confusing except i couldnt find the project info","The class wasn't confusing today. The only part of the class that I found somewhat confusing was the In-Class Assignment. The directions were relatively straightforward but slightly confusing based off how they were conveyed.
nothing
I would have wanted to go over what is on 9B's quiz more
I was initially confused about the new project but by the end I was able to understand it.  
it was somewhat confusing how broad the project is, and its confusing as far as what we need to turn in for this friday
I thought the project four was confusing
Nothing was confusing at all.
The problem statement that we wrote for the in class activity was confusing because I wasn't sure at first what we were writing it about. It took a while for me to figure out it was about the assignment 16.
I was confused about the quiz over Module 32 because I checked before class and the quiz was not available until class started so I missed this assignment.
I was a little confused about where to pull the information required for the project but I ended up figuring it out.
 I was confused by what needed to be i clouded in the problem statement at first. I originally thought we needed to find a problem already but that's not true.
 The most confusing part of class was figuring out who we were supposed to ask questions to. Since there is only 2 days until the assignment is due we are confused if we need responses from people or if we should generate them ourselves.
 All good
 The location of the assignment and the numbered steps of the assignment were confusing.
 The part of A16 where we are tasked to come up with questions and responses is confusing because of the little amount of time we have to gain actual answers. 
 Exactly what we are supposed to do in order to research our residents and end users of the product
 I was confused on what parts we had to complete on assignment 16. After talking to my team we were able to figure it out!!
 Nothing is confusing today
 The assignment 16 expectations were confusing because there were conflicting messages in different places in brightspace. This needed clarification. 
 problem scoping
 Whether the assignment due for Friday was just the first three parts of the last three parts was confusing because different documents said different things
 Nothing. I could use more clarification on the forecast of the project.
 Everything was explained well. My group faced a bit of confusion regarding what parts of the document A16 contained, but that was cleared up once Jeff visited our breakout room.
 Nothing was confusing 
 I wasn't quite sure what coefficient of determination was but I think it was mentioned previously so I will try to find it and send Jeff an email if I can't 
 The way we are going to come up with our solution doesn't make too much sense. Are we actually going to make it or just make a recommendation.
 how much we need to do for problem scoping 
 It was confusing as to what what due before class started because the Brightspace page is not always updated with the class slides or Things to do before class. 
 What specifically needed done for A16 
 There was nothing confusing in class today it all was very clear. 
 Nothing was confusing
 Nothing seemed confusing in today's class.
 what is needed for the first part of the assignment was inconsistent 
 I was confused on the part c of the problem scoping. 
 I found it confusing what we had to do for a16.
 The goal of this project was slightly confusing.
 It was confusing on how to find the full project document because it wasn't in the same place as it was for other people.
 What a stakeholder is I am confused about
 Nothing was confusing.
 I would really like for the slides to go up before or during class, questions I had about the assignment were present in the presentation, but I was not able to view them.

 The in class activity needed more explanation. We were not sure about which variables to use and how to find them. I think that we should have spent more time going over it 
 The class wasn't very confusing, it included math that most of us should know by now so it wasn't bad at all
 The most confusing part was drawing the simplified diagram.  I think the directions needed to be a little more clear on what the labels should have been.
 The most confusing part of today's class was the general idea of what we were to be doing for assignment A10
 i was kind of confused on how we are meant to simplify the diagrams
 The diagram and labeling the diagram was kind of confusing as I wasn't sure what to include. More help with this would've been nice.
 There was nothing that was confusing in class today I thought it was good and I understood all that was taught.
 Just the whole project we had a few confusing questions we would've liked to ask 
 I was confused on the first equation that we had to try  and calculate. I feel like we need to focus more on being able to identify these difficult equations to find.
 the in class participation was confusing in how to complete the calculations 
 I think we should've talked more about the laminar approach or seen more examples cause it was a little confusing. 
 I'm confused on the laminar approach and how to calculate the volume
 Nothing
 How we are supposed to figure out the mathematical model for the two different models 
 Nothing was confusing

 I didn't really know what we were supposed to be working on
 The in class assignment was confusing in what the task was and how to complete it.","There are many students who are having difficulty knowing what is needed or required for the assignment deliverables.

I was confused on when we start A11 because it said we started it today in class however I didn’t see A11 in 4A Assignments started in class and on the last slide about due dates it said A11 is due at the beginning of 5B
My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn’t know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
Due dates for assignment 10
i understood everything that the professor spoke about today.
for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
The in class assignment was a little confusing due to lack of instructions on what kind of summary and citation you were looking for.
How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
I believe that we should have talked more about scholarly materials and how we can use them for information.
The way the grading for the peer and team assessment was a little unclear.
I needed to see the slides that showed how to cite in spa a little longer for the in class assignment.
The details of what we were supposed to be working on during the studio time. The assignment is long and talked ab things I don’t think we have learned yet
Just more information about the project that we were supposed to work on.
The assignment of A10 doesn't make a lot of sense as the milestone part is somewhat confusing.
In today’s class I think that everything was pretty straightforward. At first I was little confused about the whole process of hydropower and reservoirs, but by the end of the class I totally understood it!
Today’s class was pretty clear. The discussion about how reservoirs work could have been clearer to help us better understand the process of how the energy is harvested.
I thought that everything today that was mentioned in class was pretty straightforward. There was nothing that I thought was out of the ordinary today during our lecture.
I did not find anything confusing today.
Lots of different due dates
The assignments that are due was confusing and the milestone 1 and 2 weren’t talked about
I found the information on the CATME survey to be kind of confusing. I don’t really understand what criticisms I should give my group members because I thought we all did our parts well
I wasn’t really confused on anything in today’s class. I think the instructions and tasks were pretty straight forward.
Nothing, everything was adequately explained in the lecture. The only confusing thing was the original assignment explanation, but it was cleared up.
i think the assignment 10 could have been better organized and the due dates could have been easier to find
I would be helpful to have a little more information about how to generate relevant questions to ask clients
How much detail is needed on these peer evaluations??

The most confusing part of today’s lesson was figuring out which part of the technical brief was part of A10 and A12
All of the deadlines and due dates were a little confusing, as well as the fact that only certain parts of the Taum Sauk tech brief were due.
I thought that the part about finding information was kind of confusing because it is very difficult to find information about this reservoir that is not about the failure of it. I am confused on where to find data on the Ameren website as well.
I found that the technical brief template was confusing as I am always unsure of exact specifics of how to format it.

I would have liked a few more details on some of the more open-ended/newer concepts and questions that we will need to figure out.
I believe that there was nothing really confusing about today’s class. Information was given really well. 
I was a little confused on how to work a part of the purdue library and google scholar. 
I’m not sure if this is in the plan for Friday, but if we could go through some of the math methods for A10 that would be great. There was nothing terribly confusing in the lecture, but it didn’t really cover the thing that I am confused by.
There was nothing confusing or unclear in today’s class. There could have been more guidance on how to answer the questions and how to format the answer.

It was confusing that we were reviewing what types of graphs were correct for a situation when we had already submitted an assignment with our choices of what graphs we thought best displayed data. -> 3
It was confusing that we had done an assignment on what graph we should use for data analysis but we were taught it today in class. -> 2
I was confused by all the due dates and the way the bright space is set up. I forgot to do assignment A06 because it wasn’t in the “To Do before class” category for class 4A -> 3
It’s a little confusing on knowing which graph or chart to use or if you can use more than one. -> 2
More in depth about how to make more complicated histograms -> 2
Some parts of the in class activity were confusing but it was mainly excel stuff -> 5
The lecture didn’t confuse me at all, but when we started assignment A07, I couldn’t figure out how to correctly change the bin widths. -> 3
i didn’t understand that the histograms didn’t need the date so i spent the whole break out room confused. I also think the breakout rooms should’ve been longer. -> 4
I did not know what value the histogram needed to be edited at. -> 3
Nothing was confusing -> 1
I was confused about how the in class quiz will work and what it is over. -> 1
Nothing needed more explanation in today’s class. I found everything to be very clear. However, I would have liked to know what kind of chart should have been submitted for the in class activity. -> 1
Nothing much. I think I just need to get more comfortable using histograms and understanding how to set them up using excel. -> 2
I feel like everything seemed to be pretty straight forward today! I was not confused about anything today! I felt that we really went over histograms well and it seemed to make sense to me! -> 1
Do i have to use a underflow on my histogram or is it just recommended? -> 2
I think sometimes we are unable to follow the slide or the instruction was not clear enough, so I wish professor could go into detail when performing excel stuff -> 3
Nothing -> 1
Initially I was a little confused on how to manipulate certain data within the graphs using the tables but eventually I got it sorted out -> 1
I had issues using excel with my Mac, couldn’t find the bins option when making a histogram. I’ve been having similar problems while doing other assignments. -> 4
I’m just having a lot of trouble with excel, and I’m unable to complete many of the assignments due to this. But I’ll figure it out. -> 4
I’m confused on how to find overflow/underflow values. -> 4
I feel as though the theory of histograms was explained well but the implementation of them in excel was a little lacking. -> 3
I was confused for a while because I have a Mac and could not figure out how to change the bin data. I figured out that u can change it by clicking on the value bar itself. It was helpful at the end that professor explained how to add the add on. I wish we were able to reference the slides while in breakout rooms. -> 1
The most confusing part of today’s lesson was trying to determine wether to use a line chart or a histogram. -> 2
Nothing! I feel like I understood it all today and it made sense! -> 1
There is not much things that are confusing or unclear. I understand what we are gonna do and prepare for next class, and the definition and use about histogram is clear enough for me -> 1
I believe class today was very informative. There were definitely some question about histograms that I had answered. -> 1
Everything was pretty clear today. The histograms we worked on were pretty self explanatory -> 1
I am still a little confused on when the career exploration modules/quizzes are due compared to the EYM zoom meetings and attendances. -> 1
I found everything pretty straightforward. I wish we saw the slide you were talking about that had al the due dates so we didn’t have to find it later, but other than that it was good -> 2
A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful. -> 1
I didn’t think anything was confusing even thought I was having computer troubles where I couldn’t heard anything though zoom. Other than that the histograms where explained very well. -> 1
I found some of the histogram making to be somewhat confusing mainly because I was on mac and did not know that I needed to add a tool kit to change the bins and basically the characteristics of the entire graph. -> 2
I think that maybe there could be more information on when you use histograms. I know it’s for distribution but still a little confused on when you use them all. -> 2
There were parts of the directions for A07 that were unclear, like the part about calculating bin widths and using underflow bins. -> 3
Did the homework assignment need a under flow or over flow bin? -> 1
The in class activity gave my group some confusion because it was not explained in detail, and when breakout rooms opened, we did not understand the entire assignment. -> 3
For the in class activity, it was confusing because nobody in my group had a picture of the slides and we didnt have a way to get to them, so we werent sure on what exactly we needed to do. -> 1
As I also submitted last class, I would like the option of making questions in the class during the presentation. The thing is that the Raise Hand buttton does not show much, as some peers forget it On. I would like another button, such as the tick, to mean I have a question. Thanks. -> 2
Initially, I was confusing about when exactly the A03 was due, but this was cleared up part way through the lecture. I am however still wondering if I need to e-mail the professor if I turned it in 2 minutes late today from the confusion. This seemed to be an issue across the board. -> 4
nothing was confusing except the bins for the histogram -> 2
I felt comfortable today. -> 1
The specific usage of histograms and how to format them correctly what a little confusing. Also how to sign up for the engineering school videos was still confusing. -> 3
I think everything was clear in today’s class. I’m starting to get the hang of it which is good so I can get in a routine. -> 1
Everything was pretty simple in today’s class. I didn’t really have any questions that I could not answer by reviewing the video and the slides. I am still a little confused on the EYM events. -> 1
I had a hard time creating the bins in excel for assignment 7. Everything else was pretty very clear! -> 4
I was a little confused about what graph to use in the in class activity at first. Since a histogram in my mind would also be able to be used -> 2
Everything was clearly explained. The only confusion was with the assignments we were working on. -> 1
What was most confusing in class today was adjusting the bin width by creating an under flow value because I would have to create a large value to make the bin width an integer and I was not sure if I was doing the correctly. -> 3
Not much was confusing. I understood all the concepts but the only real confusing part was figuring out how to navigate excel correctly. -> 2
Could you send out an email or something to help us keep up with assignments? Also are the before class assignments taken as a grade? -> 3
The instructions for the in class assignment wasn’t posted in the chat until near the end of the breakout room. This made the assignment difficult to complete. -> 3
I am confused on A05. We were not told how to process that much data on excel. I am not sure about how to complete this team assignment because I dont know how to divide this up and complete the assignment -> 4
how to change the bin size from the assigned bins in excel -> 3
I wish that it was easier to see the questions or prompts when we break off into our individual groups because I had trouble working on the in class activity because I didn’t know the prompt -> 1
Great, productive class today. Going a bit slower on the notes would have been nice so I could write the notes. -> 1
There was nothing confusing in the class today for me. I thought everything was explained very well. -> 1
I am still confused on how to identify Underflow Bins. -> 4
I found nothing confusing today, everything made sense to me. -> 1
The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped. -> 3
I still am unsure about the differences between categorical and nominal data. Also, when to use what chart. -> 2
The due dates is still confusing. If they were in a more compiled place, it would be extremely helpful. -> 4
I seemed to understand most the material in today’s class. The only thing would be how to keep both ur box width and box number preferences -> 2
The questions we were supposed to answer for the in class activity were not sent so it was difficult to know what were supposed to do in the excel document. -> 4
I think everything that was discussed in today’s class was clear, and there was nothing really confusing in today’s class. -> 1
Nothing really was confusing to me today. -> 1

Excel is still confusing to use. -> 4
The underflow and overflow was confusing for the bins. -> 4

Nothing needed more explanation in today’s class. I found everything to be very clear. However, I would have liked to know what kind of chart should have been submitted for the in class activity. -> 1
Nothing much. I think I just need to get more comfortable using histograms and understanding how to set them up using excel. -> 1
I feel like everything seemed to be pretty straight forward today! I was not confused about anything today! I felt that we really went over histograms well and it seemed to make sense to me! -> 1
Do i have to use a underflow on my histogram or is it just recommended? -> 3
I think sometimes we are unable to follow the slide or the instruction was not clear enough, so I wish professor could go into detail when performing excel stuff -> 4
Nothing -> 1
Initially I was a little confused on how to manipulate certain data within the graphs using the tables but eventually I got it sorted out -> 1
I had issues using excel with my Mac, couldn’t find the bins option when making a histogram. I’ve been having similar problems while doing other assignments. -> 2
I’m just having a lot of trouble with excel, and I’m unable to complete many of the assignments due to this. But I’ll figure it out. -> 4
I’m confused on how to find overflow/underflow values. -> 3
I feel as though the theory of histograms was explained well but the implementation of them in excel was a little lacking. -> 3
I was confused for a while because I have a Mac and could not figure out how to change the bin data. I figured out that u can change it by clicking on the value bar itself. It was helpful at the end that professor explained how to add the add on. I wish we were able to reference the slides while in breakout rooms. -> 3
The most confusing part of today’s lesson was trying to determine wether to use a line chart or a histogram. -> 3
Nothing! I feel like I understood it all today and it made sense! -> 1
There is not much things that are confusing or unclear. I understand what we are gonna do and prepare for next class, and the definition and use about histogram is clear enough for me -> 1
I believe class today was very informative. There were definitely some question about histograms that I had answered. -> 1
Everything was pretty clear today. The histograms we worked on were pretty self explanatory -> 1
I am still a little confused on when the career exploration modules/quizzes are due compared to the EYM zoom meetings and attendances. -> 2
I found everything pretty straightforward. I wish we saw the slide you were talking about that had al the due dates so we didn’t have to find it later, but other than that it was good -> 1
A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful. -> 3
I didn’t think anything was confusing even thought I was having computer troubles where I couldn’t heard anything though zoom. Other than that the histograms where explained very well. -> 1
I found some of the histogram making to be somewhat confusing mainly because I was on mac and did not know that I needed to add a tool kit to change the bins and basically the characteristics of the entire graph. -> 4
I think that maybe there could be more information on when you use histograms. I know it’s for distribution but still a little confused on when you use them all. -> 4
There were parts of the directions for A07 that were unclear, like the part about calculating bin widths and using underflow bins. -> 3
Did the homework assignment need a under flow or over flow bin? -> 2
The in class activity gave my group some confusion because it was not explained in detail, and when breakout rooms opened, we did not understand the entire assignment. -> 4
For the in class activity, it was confusing because nobody in my group had a picture of the slides and we didnt have a way to get to them, so we werent sure on what exactly we needed to do. -> 4
As I also submitted last class, I would like the option of making questions in the class during the presentation. The thing is that the Raise Hand buttton does not show much, as some peers forget it On. I would like another button, such as the tick, to mean I have a question. Thanks. -> 2
Initially, I was confusing about when exactly the A03 was due, but this was cleared up part way through the lecture. I am however still wondering if I need to e-mail the professor if I turned it in 2 minutes late today from the confusion. This seemed to be an issue across the board. -> 2
nothing was confusing except the bins for the histogram -> 1
I felt comfortable today. -> 1
The specific usage of histograms and how to format them correctly what a little confusing. Also how to sign up for the engineering school videos was still confusing. -> 3
I think everything was clear in today’s class. I’m starting to get the hang of it which is good so I can get in a routine. -> 1
Everything was pretty simple in today’s class. I didn’t really have any questions that I could not answer by reviewing the video and the slides. I am still a little confused on the EYM events. -> 1
I had a hard time creating the bins in excel for assignment 7. Everything else was pretty very clear! -> 3
I was a little confused about what graph to use in the in class activity at first. Since a histogram in my mind would also be able to be used -> 3
Everything was clearly explained. The only confusion was with the assignments we were working on. -> 1
What was most confusing in class today was adjusting the bin width by creating an under flow value because I would have to create a large value to make the bin width an integer and I was not sure if I was doing the correctly. -> 4
Not much was confusing. I understood all the concepts but the only real confusing part was figuring out how to navigate excel correctly. -> 1
Could you send out an email or something to help us keep up with assignments? Also are the before class assignments taken as a grade? -> 2
The instructions for the in class assignment wasn’t posted in the chat until near the end of the breakout room. This made the assignment difficult to complete. -> 4
I am confused on A05. We were not told how to process that much data on excel. I am not sure about how to complete this team assignment because I dont know how to divide this up and complete the assignment -> 2
how to change the bin size from the assigned bins in excel -> 3
I wish that it was easier to see the questions or prompts when we break off into our individual groups because I had trouble working on the in class activity because I didn’t know the prompt -> 4

The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped. -> 4
I still am unsure about the differences between categorical and nominal data. Also, when to use what chart. -> 3
The due dates is still confusing. If they were in a more compiled place, it would be extremely helpful. -> 2
I seemed to understand most the material in today’s class. The only thing would be how to keep both ur box width and box number preferences -> 1

 As I also submitted last class, I would like the option of making questions in the class during the presentation. The thing is that the Raise Hand buttton does not show much, as some peers forget it On. I would like another button, such as the tick, to mean I have a question. Thanks.
 Some parts of the in class activity were confusing but it was mainly excel stuff
 I did not know what value the histogram needed to be edited at. 
 nothing was confusing except the bins for the histogram
 The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped.
 The due dates is still confusing. If they were in a more compiled place, it would be extremely helpful.
 Everything was clearly explained. The only confusion was with the assignments we were working on.
 Initially, I was confusing about when exactly the A03 was due, but this was cleared up part way through the lecture. I am however still wondering if I need to e-mail the professor if I turned it in 2 minutes late today from the confusion. This seemed to be an issue across the board.
 It was confusing that we had done an assignment on what graph we should use for data analysis but we were taught it today in class.
 I feel as though the theory of histograms was explained well but the implementation of them in excel was a little lacking.
 I am confused on A05. We were not told how to process that much data on excel. I am not sure about how to complete this team assignment because I dont know how to divide this up and complete the assignment 
 There were parts of the directions for A07 that were unclear, like the part about calculating bin widths and using underflow bins. 
 I think everything that was discussed in today’s class was clear, and there was nothing really confusing in today’s class.
 There is not much things that are confusing or unclear. I understand what we are gonna do and prepare for next class, and the definition and use about histogram is clear enough for me","In this lecture, students had trouble calculating, editing, and using bins for histograms in Excel. Additionally, students did not understand how to find or when to use overflow and underflow bins. Students were also unsure about which graph is best for a certain situation, and some expressed difficulty creating and understanding histograms in particular. Finally, students were unclear about due dates and assingment instructions.","Balancing number of bins and bin width A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful. I still am unsure about the differences between categorical and nominal data. Also, when to use what chart. The specific usage of histograms and how to format them correctly what a little confusing. Also how to sign up for the engineering school videos was still confusing.

how to change the bin size from the assigned bins in excel
I found everything pretty straightforward. I wish we saw the slide you were talking about that had al the due dates so we didn't have to find it later, but other than that it was good
I am still a little confused on when the career exploration modules/quizzes are due compared to the EYM zoom meetings and attendances.
Nothing was confusing because it was just a rehash of the Brightspace modules.
I believe class today was very informative. There were definitely some question about histograms that I had answered.
I was confused by all the due dates and the way the bright space is set up. I forgot to do assignment A06 because it wasn't in the “To Do before class” category for class 4A
I had a hard time creating the bins in excel for assignment 7. Everything else was pretty very clear!
Nothing was confusing
It was confusing that we were reviewing what types of graphs were correct for a situation when we had already submitted an assignment with our choices of what graphs we thought best displayed data.
The in class activity gave my group some confusion because it was not explained in detail, and when breakout rooms opened, we did not understand the entire assignment.
Nothing! I feel like I understood it all today and it made sense!
I am still confused on how to identify Underflow Bins.
I was confused for a while because I have a Mac and could not figure out how to change the bin data. I figured out that u can change it by clicking on the value bar itself. It was helpful at the end that professor explained how to add the add on. I wish we were able to reference the slides while in breakout rooms.
I'm confused on how to find overflow/underflow values.
I had issues using excel with my Mac, couldn't find the bins option when making a histogram. I've been having similar problems while doing other assignments.
There was nothing confusing in the class today for me. I thought everything was explained very well.
More in depth about how to make more complicated histograms
i didn't understand that the histograms didn't need the date so i spent the whole break out room confused. I also think the breakout rooms should've been longer.
It's a little confusing on knowing which graph or chart to use or if you can use more than one.
Do i have to use a underflow on my histogram or is it just recommended?
Nothing really was confusing to me today.
The questions we were supposed to answer for the in class activity were not sent so it was difficult to know what were supposed to do in the excel document.
I didn't think anything was confusing even thought I was having computer troubles where I couldn't heard anything though zoom. Other than that the histograms where explained very well.
I think sometimes we are unable to follow the slide or the instruction was not clear enough, so I wish professor could go into detail when performing excel stuff
Everything was pretty clear today. The histograms we worked on were pretty self explanatory
I still am unsure about the differences between categorical and nominal data. Also, when to use what chart.
I seemed to understand most the material in today's class. The only thing would be how to keep both ur box width and box number preferences
Could you send out an email or something to help us keep up with assignments? Also are the before class assignments taken as a grade?
Nothing much. I think I just need to get more comfortable using histograms and understanding how to set them up using excel.
I feel like everything seemed to be pretty straight forward today! I was not confused about anything today! I felt that we really went over histograms well and it seemed to make sense to me!
The specific usage of histograms and how to format them correctly what a little confusing. Also how to sign up for the engineering school videos was still confusing.
I found some of the histogram making to be somewhat confusing mainly because I was on mac and did not know that I needed to add a tool kit to change the bins and basically the characteristics of the entire graph.
Initially I was a little confused on how to manipulate certain data within the graphs using the tables but eventually I got it sorted out
Balancing number of bins and bin width
Nothing needed more explanation in today's class. I found everything to be very clear. However, I would have liked to know what kind of chart should have been submitted for the in class activity.
I'm just having a lot of trouble with excel, and I'm unable to complete many of the assignments due to this. But I'll figure it out.
nothing
Nothing was confusing today. I have a good understanding of using histograms in excel.
What was most confusing in class today was adjusting the bin width by creating an under flow value because I would have to create a large value to make the bin width an integer and I was not sure if I was doing the correctly.
Great, productive class today. Going a bit slower on the notes would have been nice so I could write the notes.
For the in class activity, it was confusing because nobody in my group had a picture of the slides and we didnt have a way to get to them, so we werent sure on what exactly we needed to do.
I think everything was clear in today's class. I'm starting to get the hang of it which is good so I can get in a routine.

The most confusing part of today's lesson was trying to determine wether to use a line chart or a histogram.
The lecture didn't confuse me at all, but when we started assignment A07, I couldn't figure out how to correctly change the bin widths.
Everything was pretty simple in today's class. I didn't really have any questions that I could not answer by reviewing the video and the slides. I am still a little confused on the EYM events.

I think that maybe there could be more information on when you use histograms. I know it's for distribution but still a little confused on when you use them all.
Did the homework assignment need a under flow or over flow bin?
The instructions for the in class assignment wasn't posted in the chat until near the end of the breakout room. This made the assignment difficult to complete.
I didn't find anything confusing during class. I felt that the presentation and class overall moved at consistent and helpful speed and everything was related in a non-confusing manner.
I wish that it was easier to see the questions or prompts when we break off into our individual groups because I had trouble working on the in class activity because I didn't know the prompt
I was confused about how the in class quiz will work and what it is over.
As I also submitted last class, I would like the option of making questions in the class during the presentation. The thing is that the Raise Hand buttton does not show much, as some peers forget it On. I would like another button, such as the tick, to mean I have a question. Thanks.
Some parts of the in class activity were confusing but it was mainly excel stuff
I did not know what value the histogram needed to be edited at.
nothing was confusing except the bins for the histogram
The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped.

Everything was clearly explained. The only confusion was with the assignments we were working on.
Initially, I was confusing about when exactly the A03 was due, but this was cleared up part way through the lecture. I am however still wondering if I need to e-mail the professor if I turned it in 2 minutes late today from the confusion. This seemed to be an issue across the board.
It was confusing that we had done an assignment on what graph we should use for data analysis but we were taught it today in class.
I feel as though the theory of histograms was explained well but the implementation of them in excel was a little lacking.
I am confused on A05. We were not told how to process that much data on excel. I am not sure about how to complete this team assignment because I dont know how to divide this up and complete the assignment
There were parts of the directions for A07 that were unclear, like the part about calculating bin widths and using underflow bins.

 The explanation of the payback equation was overcomplicated and made it sound way harder than it actually was. Also would've helped to have the equation in the chat.","While many of the students didn't have any problems in today's class, there were some issues when it came to calculating certain variables. Two that were highlighted specifically was the payback period and the environmental analysis. Some students also mentioned that they had some issues with their calculations because they were missing information, so it might be worthwhile reviewing documents to check for any missing information that needs to be included. There was also some mentions of missing info for an Excel document, so it might be worthwhile to review that, as well."," Just for me personally, I had a hard time calculating thecapitalinvestment, but when you showed the slide on how to do it, ithelpedclarify some of my confusion Something that was confusing in today’s class was what apaybackperiodmeant.

Just for me personally, I had a hard time calculating the capital investment, but when you showed the slide on how to do it, it helped clarify some of my confusion
Everything went smoothly in today's class. The economic aspects of our upcoming project were explained well by Professor Menekse, and I'm very satisfied with today's lecture. I also appreciate the extended work time we got today.
I was a little bit confused initially on how to solve the in class example. I think I must've missed a slide on it from before but I quickly figured it out. My team and I are having a rough start to the A13 project; we are finding step 4 a little bit confusing or tedious.
I would like it if the professor let us know when our grades were put in so we could check them sooner.
My group had confusion on our assignment 12 feedback, but we got our questions answered.
One thing that was confusing today was how do you account for the potential of some months having varying total days in the month. Would you just account for the lowest amount of days, just to give the bare minimum electricity production for that month?
Specifics of the in class activity.
I think we could have covered more things in today's time. Had a lot more time in first breakout room than was needed.
I was unsure about some of the constraints that were revealed in class about A13 as I did not see them in the technical brief or the assignment's information page, specifically about the amount of time that the payback period must be under.

Two that were highlighted specifically was the payback period and the environmental analysis. Some students also mentioned that they had some issues with their calculations because they were missing information, so it might be worthwhile reviewing documents to check for any missing information that needs to be included.

Working with my group on the Assignment 12 -> 5
I liked how we had enough class time to really get into A12 and divide out the work. Our team now has a good foundation for completing this assignment. -> 2
I did not know that one quiz would be dropped at the end of the semester -> 4
You don't have to go through the full process of creating a chart to find the trendline, you can just use the built in formulas -> 3
It was mostly breakout rooms today so not much was talked about -> 1
Again, the lesson served more as an explanation of what's going on with the exam and quiz, so I didn't find much to be interesting. -> 1
Nothing in today’s class was particularly interesting. -> 1
I found A12 interesting and I am looking forward to working on it with my team. It’s interesting because we are analyzing the reservoir’s functionality for a specific day. -> 4

53,102,102,Alex,engr131_s015-fall2020,17,Describe what you found most confusing in today’s class,"nothing -> 1
There was really nothing too confusing in today's class. Everything was seaplane in great detail from the client needs and stakeholders to the in class activity. -> 1
Nothing -> 1
The executive summary part of A16 -> 4
Nothing was confusing as the project was well-flushed out and explored -> 1
unclear how much needs to be done for background information because it seems like it could be an extremely large and time-consuming section. -> 3
Nothing was confusing in today’s class -> 1
How to incorperate stakeholders into the project. -> 2
We were confused about finding certain documents for the assignments but we eventually found them. -> 1
The only confusing part about todays class was determining the criteria and constraints for the problem statement in the in class activity -> 2
The confusing part of today’s class was how to address stakeholders. -> 4
I was wondering why the quiz got moved to in class -> 1
I was confused on where to find the documents for this assignment -> 3
The brightspace said to do sections 1,2,3,4 but another page said only needfinding and problem scoping -> 5
Nothing was confusing or hard in today’s class. It was pretty straightforward and smooth. No technological errors or other difficulties. It was somewhat hard -> 1
The project goalposts were confusing because they're so soon and we have a lot to crunch into 2 days. -> 3
One thing that was confusing about today’s class was do you account for criteria that isn’t stated by the client in the problem statement or just in the table for criteria and constraints? -> 3
Something that could have used more details in today’s class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial. -> 4
Something that needed more detail in today’s class was the process of going back later on in the project to the problem statement and other parts of the problem scoping section. It wasn’t really expanded upon and I felt like it could have used a little more explaining than what was given. -> 1
I thought it was confusing when we were going over the details of the design project as far as the problem we are trying to solve. If we’re supposed to improve safety how should we go about objectively seeing safety information -> 3
I was confused on the metrics section. -> 4
The purpose of the design project seemed very vague. It didn’t seem like there was a lot of direction for the project, nor was it made clear what data is to be collected to create a solution. -> 4
Not much was confusing in today’s class. Topics that we have completed were reviewed in preparation for the final research project, so nothing too confusing. -> 1
I was a little confused on the Empathizing with users portion of the technical brief today. -> 3
I didn’t think much was confusing in today’s class, as I felt I understood the material very well. -> 1
More details about what is due for the first milestone -> 4
I think that sometimes knowing the difference between criteria and constraints as well as trying to come up with different stakeholders can be confusing. -> 2
Everything about the class was understandable and easy to follow, I believe it was well planned -> 1
Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day. -> 4
The difference between criteria and constraints is a little confusing still -> 3
I was having some difficulty understanding what separated a stakeholder from a client/end user, but it was eventually cleared up by the professor's explanation -> 2
My group was confused about the requirements for assignment 16 because the submission box says that sections II, III, and IV are due, but the assignment document says that just sections II and III are due. -> 4
Learning what the differences were between a novice engineer and an experienced one. -> 3
Everything was straightforward forward and easy to understand and interpret -> 1
Details regarding the quiz, also the work load is unexpectedly large in a short amount of time -> 4
The discussion on the requirements of assignment 16 was a bitconfusing. It was hard to tell what we needed to do given the materials. -> 3
The assignment details for A16 were slightly confusing, but were able to be figured out. -> 2
The issues with clarity on the project. It was not laid out well. -> 4
Nothing really -> 1

I found the advice on how to do the activity incredibly helpful. My team was wrongly doing the activity, and without the clarification likely would have turned it in without meeting the requirements. -> 3
It was interesting to see how going over the pros and cons for an idea can change designs. -> 3
I enjoyed the idea of the in class activity despite the poor topic. It was good practice in determining pros and cons. -> 3
I liked the evaluation of pros/cons of the costumer service. I think maybe you could give us questions to think about if we need to further evaluate pros/cons for any project -> 4
I found our discussion of pros and cons very interesting today, especially when it came to how they related to engineering -> 3
This whole design project really appeals to me and I’m excited to draw out the sketches for my group. -> 4
Going over what we should do in assignment 17 was extremely helpful to my team. We would have done the assignment incorrectly if we hadn’t gone over the assignment expectations in class. -> 5
Not many things happened today, I did like the in class activity which made me think outside the box. -> 2

Prototyping -> 3
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I’m unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions. -> 5
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. -> 2
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea -> 4
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. -> 3
Nothing was confusing in today’s class -> 1
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype -> 2
Something that could use more details in today’s class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn’t catch all the dates. -> 1
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. -> 4
I thought the most difficult aspect of today’s class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them. -> 2
How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don’t remember going over it in the video modules and it isn’t explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams’ understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. -> 3
The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them. -> 4
Everything made sense into today’s class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense. -> 2
I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used -> 3
What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don’t have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted) -> 4
The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions. -> 2
A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren’t easily accessible. -> 2
I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well. -> 2
I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. -> 3
It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren’t really something we can just go out and test. -> 3
How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials. -> 2
I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be. -> 2
Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear -> 1
I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week. -> 3
I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process. -> 4
I wasn’t confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong. -> 1
I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow. -> 4
How we should go about testing any physical model that we create -> 4
I would’ve appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful. -> 3
I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes. -> 3
Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible. -> 3
One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test? -> 3
I found it confusing how we are going to create a prototype for some of our designs -> 4
I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don’t always have the resources -> 2
What options we would have for making prototypes. If there were things we are not allowed to do on campus that would limit what we can do. -> 3
How in depth the experiments should be -> 3
I was confused as to how to actually test a prototype. -> 1
Nothing today -> 1
nothing was confusing -> 1
The research method and way of testing was confusing. Nothing was clarified. -> 4
More details about the testing procedure section would be helpful -> 3
Thinking of prototypes while most of our ideas had to do with the road was confusing -> 3
Nothing was confusing today. There was nothing to be confusing though because everything explained had to do with methods of prototyping. -> 1
We only had one confusing point during the lecture, we didn’t understand if it was supposed to be 3 different designs or 3 different ideas prototyped. This was solved however in our breakout room -> 2
Nothing was confusing today! Professor Menekse explained the prototyping process well, which helped us to discuss ways to make prototype our designs -> 1

There are also some concerns about specifics when it comes to the assignment and what is required for submissions. "," We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we wouldbuilda prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make themindividually,physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to ourseparation. How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don’tremembergoing over it in the video modules and it isn’t explained inthetechnical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going throughanexample of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins wouldhavebeen beneficial to the teams’ understanding of what a testingprotocolis and how to develop an effective one.  The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it downfor next Friday.

 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren't easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
 I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.
 Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear 
 I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week. 
 I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process. 
 I wasn't confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
 I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
 How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
 I would've appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.
 I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes. 
 Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test?
 I found it confusing how we are going to create a prototype for some of our designs
 I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don't always have the resources
 What options we would have for making prototypes. If there were things we are not allowed to do on campus that would limit what we can do. 
 How in depth the experiments should be
 I was confused as to how to actually test a prototype. 
 Nothing today 
 nothing was confusing
 The research method and way of testing was confusing. Nothing was clarified.
 More details about the testing procedure section would be helpful 
 Thinking of prototypes while most of our ideas had to do with the road was confusing
 Nothing was confusing today. There was nothing to be confusing though because everything explained had to do with methods of prototyping.
 We only had one confusing point during the lecture, we didn't understand if it was supposed to be 3 different designs or 3 different ideas prototyped. This was solved however in our breakout room 
 Nothing was confusing today! Professor Menekse explained the prototyping process well, which helped us to discuss ways to make prototype our designs
 Everything was clear and easy to understand
 How we should make a prototype that we can also test, for example cad models would be hard to test for a18.
 Nothing
 the specifications of assignment 18 needed a bit more clarification, but otherwise all was pretty clear 
 I was confused by the way we can implement questions for the concrete details","The students have many questions regarding prototyping.

There are also some concerns about specifics when it comes to the assignment and what is required for submissions.

There wasn’t much confusing work to do the only thing I can think of to be confusing was why we were giving the density of gasoline in our in class activity. When we calculated it with out it
I was not confused by anything in today’s class and I actually thought everything was very well explained in depth.
I did not find anything confusing in todays class.
Nothing.
Nothing at all! I really enjoyed the presentation today as it was very informative and helped us to better understand our tasks for Assignment 13.
I think it’s confusing to determine which recommendation to make to the mayor, in regards to design trade offs and ethics of engineering and climate change versus economic feasibility.
This class was well informed and well taught
The extra information with carbon footprint calculation threw us off. It should have not given us the gasoline density because it's completely irrelevant to our current calculations.
Nothing, everything was clear.

there wasn't anything confusing today. 
I think we could have went into greater detail with the repercussions that environmental proceeding have on engineering focus rather than focus on how environmental factors are proceeding
The way the carbon emission was calculated was a tad bit confusing.
I was confused about the in class activity at first but when I discussed it with my group we figured it out.

Nothing was confusing in today’s class
One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how do you know if your assumptions are something the client would want you to make or if they are something they wouldn’t see relevant?
I found the carbon footprint information confusing because I was not sure how to take the environmental data from A13 and reflect a carbon footprint.
I was a little bit confused about how the in class activity related to the environmental analysis. I understand that we need to find the CO2 emissions in the economic analysis, but I don’t understand how the equation we used for the in class activity should be used in the environmental analysis. 
 Nothing confusing for today
 it was somewhat difficult to get the calculations for the in class activity
 There wasn’t really anything in today’s lecture that I found to be confusing or unclear. Everything stated was easily understood and tied in directly to being an engineer and our current project. Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints 
 I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time. 
 The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity. 
 We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slide about the calculations for the participation’s other than to try to trip us up.
 I thought that more details could have been given about the individual effects of climate change.
 Not much was confusing about the lecture today. Everything was clearly expressed. 
 How to calculate the commerical energu price with a 3 year payback period
 Nothing in today’s class was really confusing. We could have gone over how to calculate CO2 emissions more, which would have been helpful for A13. But overall, nothing was super confusing/ needed clarification.
 I needed more detail about co2 emission for calculation
 I think what was explained in class made sense. I’m glad the carbon emission information was discussed in class because I was confused where the conversions came from. 
 There was nothing that was overly confusing or difficult to accomplish in today’s lecture. It was pretty starightforward and easy to progress theough.
 Today’s class was not confusing at all and I didn’t have any problems during it. 
 The most confusing part of class today was the discussion of what assumptions to make and how to communicate those. 
 Nothing in class was confusing 
 The carbon emissions calculation was a little confusing because I didn’t understand where the numbers were coming from at first. The example after the in class activity cleared things up.
 Nothing was confusing
 The confusing part of today’s class was the use of the values of solar energy to create a figure or chart. 
 I was confused to why there was the concentration of gas put in the in class assignment slide, my assumption was that it was to confuse us but it seemed meaningless.

Nothing in class was confusing
The carbon emissions calculation was a little confusing because I didn't understand where the numbers were coming from at first. The example after the in class activity cleared things up.
Nothing was confusing
The confusing part of today's class was the use of the values of solar energy to create a figure or chart.
I was confused to why there was the concentration of gas put in the in class assignment slide, my assumption was that it was to confuse us but it seemed meaningless.
Class was a bit confusing on some of the requirements for the projects.
I was at first confused how to solve the in class assignment.
There wasn't much confusing work to do the only thing I can think of to be confusing was why we were giving the density of gasoline in our in class activity. When we calculated it with out it
I was not confused by anything in today's class and I actually thought everything was very well explained in depth.
I did not find anything confusing in todays class.
Nothing.
Nothing at all! I really enjoyed the presentation today as it was very informative and helped us to better understand our tasks for Assignment 13.
I think it's confusing to determine which recommendation to make to the mayor, in regards to design trade offs and ethics of engineering and climate change versus economic feasibility.
This class was well informed and well taught
The extra information with carbon footprint calculation threw us off. It should have not given us the gasoline density because it's completely irrelevant to our current calculations.
Nothing, everything was clear.

I found the portion of the lecture on assumptions to be a little confusing, as it isn't made too clear the difference between an assumption and data that just isn't reliable.","in-class activity
there wasn't anything confusing today. 
I think we could have went into greater detail with the repercussions that environmental proceeding have on engineering focus rather than focus on how environmental factors are proceeding
The way the carbon emission was calculated was a tad bit confusing.
I was confused about the in class activity at first but when I discussed it with my group we figured it out. 
I did not find anything confusing in today's class
Nothing was confusing in today's class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how do you know if your assumptions are something the client would want you to make or if they are something they wouldn't see relevant?
I found the carbon footprint information confusing because I was not sure how to take the environmental data from A13 and reflect a carbon footprint.
I was a little bit confused about how the in class activity related to the environmental analysis. I understand that we need to find the CO2 emissions in the economic analysis, but I don't understand how the equation we used for the in class activity should be used in the environmental analysis. 
 Nothing confusing for today
 it was somewhat difficult to get the calculations for the in class activity
 There wasn't really anything in today's lecture that I found to be confusing or unclear. Everything stated was easily understood and tied in directly to being an engineer and our current project. Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society.
 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints 
 I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time. 
 The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity. 
 We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slide about the calculations for the participation's other than to try to trip us up.
 I thought that more details could have been given about the individual effects of climate change.
 Not much was confusing about the lecture today. Everything was clearly expressed. 
 How to calculate the commerical energu price with a 3 year payback period
 Nothing in today's class was really confusing. We could have gone over how to calculate CO2 emissions more, which would have been helpful for A13. But overall, nothing was super confusing/ needed clarification.
 I needed more detail about co2 emission for calculation
 I think what was explained in class made sense. I'm glad the carbon emission information was discussed in class because I was confused where the conversions came from. 
 There was nothing that was overly confusing or difficult to accomplish in today's lecture. It was pretty starightforward and easy to progress theough.

 Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn't find anything about this lecture confusing.
 How to search for data quickly.
 The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
 What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
 Something that needed more detail in today's class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). Information on Laminar Flow and other topics that others may not know about can be explained, even if briefly, to help give a general idea of the topic to the students.","In this lecture, students were confused about how to complete assignment A10. Additionally and more specifically, students were confused by how to use the Laminar approach and how to employ mathematical models in this assignment. Similarly, students were confused about how to complete the in-class activity and what was being asked; some needed more time. Students also had questions about how to find and cite reliable sources and what sources are acceptable for use. Finally, students wanted more background on the Taum Sauk reservoir and how hydroelectric dams work in general.",Something that needed more detail in today's class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). |_| What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class.  |_| It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone. |_| Explanation for what the client memo was outlining |_| I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest ,"Assignment 10, A10

None, the in class activity and accompanying video on finding initial velocity made sense
It was a little confusing when looking at what we are supposed to explain in milestone 1- the way to code the solution or the way to get the solution.
I think everything was clear for the most part. Maybe would helpful to go over more info regarding the structure of the project.
I would have loved more clarification regarding A14 during todays class. While we focused a lot on the milestones, little to no mention was made of this assignment.
I was confused about the questions in milestone 1 and whether they were estimations or specific to all the later substrates in the project.
Parts of M1 were confusing but my group was able to work it out. Also the overall project needs to be explained a little more I feel like.
I found finding the initial velocity slope confusing","Everything in class today made sense
I was confused on the process of finding v max for the graphs given.
I did not understand where and why we need references for Milestone 1 and it was something that made the assignment much more confusing than it had to as all this stuff is basic knowledge.
I was a bit confused between M1a and M1. M1a was due today and M1 is due a week from today.

Todays activity which was about the pseudo-coding the Voi was pretty interesting and I learned the meaning of the pseudo code this way.
We were able to code getting our vo graphs and they looked how we were expecting. So that was pretty cool to see
I found the in class activity most interesting today. It was a team activity and we were so indulge in that the time went to quickly.
Again it was fun to work with my groupmates and I found it interesting that we have to use user defined functions to create our code.
Nothing was interesting today.
The concept of how we can code something to do math and read data for us is very interesting.
I thought that doing the code of cooperation with my entire group was the most interesting because we got to discuss more about how we work as a group together. It was a real bonding moment.
I loved putting my teams ideas together and feeling the success of completing half of our code.","I found it interesting that we are able to code a MATLAB algorithm that can sift through large amounts of data and use non linear regression to find meaningful parameters that determine the effectiveness of certain enzymes.

 I found this week's material to be challenging but manageable. The concept of user-defined functions was new to me
 and I struggled with understanding the order of UDF variables. The team activity was also a bit confusing
 and I would have appreciated more guidance on how to classify and rate teammate attributes. The A09 assignment was difficult
 and I wish there had been more explanation and support for the harder parts. However
 I did understand the material discussed in class easily
 and I appreciated the opportunity to learn something new."

I found the review problems for the exam to be most interesting, as I realized I had forgotten some of the stuff for the quiz. -> 3
I found it most interesting when we were talking about the concept quizzes and seeing the wide variety of answers you could have.  -> 3
I found it interesting to use if statements and else if in order to find the output based on certain conditions. -> 4

How many ways for loops can be used. They can be modified to do many different things.  -> 3
I was very interested in the concept quiz information as I found out about that if else functions are on the exam.

how to use for loop
The for statements allow you to find cool methods to add to each previous values or even calculate an average. Will be useful for upcoming assignments
I really enjoyed meeting with my team for the first time in person! This was our first in class activity as a group, and it was great to better develop our team dynamic
it was most interesting meeting with my group and getting to know them.
I found it interesting how all of the material we have learned builds upon itself. The coding is getting more complicated, but it is making a little bit more sense.
The structure of for loops compared to while loops
 I was intrigued, yet again, by the various applications of MATLAB's efficient user interface to solve application problems in the real world.

 It was nice to meet my team and get some practice with for functions. The hot chocolate was also very cool.
 I found it interesting that hints to the homework are given out on the class' Slack. I wouldn't expect hints to be given out at all, but I do like that they are there. I will have to use Slack more often because I currently don't check it at all.
 I found the review problems for the exam to be most interesting, as I realized I had forgotten some of the stuff for the quiz.
 I found it most interesting when we were talking about the concept quizzes and seeing the wide variety of answers you could have. 
 I found it interesting to use if statements and else if in order to find the output based on certain conditions.
 I found the in class activity very interesting as we were using for loops within the real world. In addition, I noticed how useful MatLab can be in the real world.
 How many ways for loops can be used. They can be modified to do many different things. 
 I was very interested in the concept quiz information as I found out about that if else functions are on the exam. I learned more about what if else functions do such that the order must be if else if then else then end or if else end. Else cannot come before elseif and the order is very important.

Main function calling -> 2
Everything made sense -> 1
There was not much of anything really confusing today in class. In fact, the lecture was explained well and it was very detailed and explained precisely. -> 1
I wish we talked more about the structure of A10 in class -> 3
I was confused about how to begin the individual problem for A10. I did not understand how to find the center of mass from the equations they gave us -> 4
nothing -> 1
Nothing was confusing, I found the lecture to be pretty straightforward. The slides and the lecture itself (typing through the code in matlab together) helped me understand main functions and sub functions! -> 1
the functions within a function were explained too fast, and the instructions could b clearer with maybe a video for am example -> 4
How the main function is different from a normal function -> 3
I felt that the efficiency of problem 2 on A10 is a little confusing. It teaches us about UDFs more, but is less efficient than writing everything in the main function. -> 3
The part that was confusing was the main loop. I was confused because I was not sure if you could put the sub functions in the script of the main function, or if you just need to type the commands into the command window.  -> 4
What main functions are good for. It still seems like they are the same thing as scripts.  -> 3
Needed help understanding the for loops a little more and the in class activity needed to be clearer -> 3
I thought it was confusing trying to figure out how to format the comments for user defined functions. I just wanted to make sure I was doing it right.  -> 3
Nothing was very confusing today. Straightforward class and good examples.  -> 1
User defined functions are still a bit confusing in terms of how to format and work them. -> 3
How to not mess up UDF and main function -> 3

Main function calling
Everything made sense
There was not much of anything really confusing today in class. In fact, the lecture was explained well and it was very detailed and explained precisely.
I wish we talked more about the structure of A10 in class
I was confused about how to begin the individual problem for A10. I did not understand how to find the center of mass from the equations they gave us
Nothing was confusing, I found the lecture to be pretty straightforward. The slides and the lecture itself (typing through the code in matlab together) helped me understand main functions and sub functions!
the functions within a function were explained too fast, and the instructions could b clearer with maybe a video for am example
How the main function is different from a normal function
I felt that the efficiency of problem 2 on A10 is a little confusing. It teaches us about UDFs more, but is less efficient than writing everything in the main function.
 The part that was confusing was the main loop. I was confused because I was not sure if you could put the sub functions in the script of the main function, or if you just need to type the commands into the command window. 
 What main functions are good for. It still seems like they are the same thing as scripts. 
 Needed help understanding the for loops a little more and the in class activity needed to be clearer
 I thought it was confusing trying to figure out how to format the comments for user defined functions. I just wanted to make sure I was doing it right. 
 Nothing was very confusing today. Straightforward class and good examples. 
 User defined functions are still a bit confusing in terms of how to format and work them.

Solving for the time it takes for electrons to move from a car battery to the starter motor and understanding that the result does not need to be a small number in order for the car to start, since there is still a lot of current flowing to the the motor.
I found the parallel capacitors interesting because you are able to combine capacitors together when they are parallel to each other 
Examining electricity in motion is reaply interesting after looking at it static for so long

Resistivity of uniform wire 
Drift velocity and current resistance 
I thought it was interesting creating the series scenarios. It's sort of engaging cresting your own picture of a circuit. 
I found it interesting that capacitances can be added to get Ceq.
 Calculating capacitance in circuits
 How the current ""flows""through a conductor
 We can calculate the numeric value of complicated electrical concepts in physics.  
 I found it interesting how we are now drawing our circuits in series and parallel. Itvs interesting to see how electricity works in the real world. ","The students really enjoyed the examples of current in class, and also enjoyed studying circuits. They enjoyed looking at components of these circuits and the calculations of current, resistance, capacitance, etc. The real world examples seemed to click with them.","I found it interesting how we are now drawing our circuits in series and parallel.

In the example problem, you would pull numbers and I was not sure where the numbers would be from. Could you be more clear on where these numbers would be coming from in class?","The part that confused me the most was when we were looking at a conductor and an insulator and trying to figure out the electric field value of each shell. 
I thought that the explanation with the last practice problem was kind of confusing. I still am not sure what the total induced charge is.
The problem that we went into breakout rooms for was very difficult and I think it would’ve been better if we went over it a little bit before we went to breakout rooms
Choosing a Gaussian surface. I’m still not sure what types/orientations of surfaces produce symmetry that allow certain components to cancel out.
I think that I struggled with figured out the electric flux using the integral. I also was confused on when doing the gauss’ law problems how you chose the proper surface to use. 
Maybe more into detail reg the choosing of Gaussian surface?  
I found the whole concept of flux very unclear. I didn't really grasp it on the fundamental level and the mathematical interpretation of the concept doesn't make sense to me. 
The way the magnitude is multiplied by two or is zero based off of arrows in problems. 
The integral equation. I think more examples would help
I think the most confusing thing for me was visualizing the electric flux, specifically how you can tell the flux based on the amount of field lines
 how to know if E is along the surface, perpendicular to the surface, or constant 
 More explanation about isolated conductors and Gauss' Law would be helpful especially determine the charge. 
 I was a little confused about what it means to choose a Gaussian surface.

 I found it most interesting that when E is a constant, it can be pulled out of the integration and all that’s left is area.

 I found it interesting that an electric field can flow through a surface. I also found it interesting that you can calculate the charge enclosed in an area
 I thought it was interesting how we can prove the equation for E is correct by doing some math.
 I found out that Gauss’s law is just flux over an imaginary shape, like a potato. I think this helped clear up much of my confusion.
 I had heard of Faraday Cages but I didn't really know what they were or how they worked so that was interesting
 The water example gave me an idea of the concept, but I still don’t feel strong about the subject.

Much was very thorough and clear. I had some issues understanding the diagrams at first, not sure why. Seems a few others were confused with how to interpret the diagram as well.

I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient.

What I found unclear was the lightbulb lighting up due to the work done by the professor. It was stated that the work done caused the lightbulb to light up and the electrons moving into the lightbulb.
The uses for coulombs law in specific
In today’s class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works.
The idea of grounding was unclear to me. I did not understand how charge can be left over in a particle after it has been grounded.
Overall, today’s class was really good! I thought that each tophat question was well explained. I was a little confused with some of the math steps you took in simplifying, because you never showed any conversions, but the whole concept was clear.
I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could’ve been more in-depth.
I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense.
I really didn’t understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it’s q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn’t know where to go from there to solve for F’ or F because I didn’t know what it defined as F’ and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me.
I was confused about how the energy from Dr. Nero was what caused the lightbulb to light up in the experiment.
The beginning of the lecture about charges was a bit rushed and I think it would be a valuable thing to go over since it is the building blocks of electric forces
i enjoyed today’s class. i struggled when all the forces were being applied onto the one force. i didn’t understand this because i couldn’t seem to figure out why that one force just became 0.

 i enjoyed today's class. i struggled when all the forces were being applied onto the one force. i didn't understand this because i couldn't seem to figure out why that one force just became 0. 
 I think today's class was good. The breakout rooms did help me meet some new students. I was also able to understand the content well, as I solved the questions on my own before the professor. It would be great if we could have Q n A sometime during lecture. 
 I was confused about the way to break up the components in the last problem. I forgot about vector math from physics 1. The breakout room for one of the problems was not helpful, my group did not participate.
 I was a little bit confused on Shell Theorems in today's class because the two Theorems seem to be very similar and I'm having trouble understanding the difference between the two. 
 I felt that the lecture was well explained. I believe that one would only find it confusing if they didn't watch the prerecorded lectures before hand. 
 Coulomb's law Shell Theorems
 I found the second shell theorem to be confusing. Is there no electric force on the particle because the shell it is in is charged? ","Many of the students in today's lecture had trouble with the in class questions and tophat questions. There was also some confusion with the light bulb demonstration, as well as confusion with concepts such as shell theorem, coulomb's law, and other things such as particles and charges.","In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works. |_| What I found unclear was the lightbulb lighting up due to the work done by the professor. It was stated that the work done caused the lightbulb to light up and the electrons moving into the lightbulb. |_| I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem. |_| The idea of grounding was unclear to me. I did not understand how charge can be left over in a particle after it has been grounded. |_| I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing.

 In today’s video, I found the tension in the ham and tug-o-war the most interesting. It was cool to find out that the tension is the same for the hams
 How tension is the same across the entire string regardless of length.
 I thought the problem with the two pieces of meat hanging by the rope connected to the spring scale was a good way for me to understand the concept of tension
 I found the example problems very helpful. They help reinforce my understand about the material 
 I really enjoyed the tension/Newton’s 3rd Law problems. They’re tricky and confusing, but I think with a little more practice they can be fun for me. 
 Starting the incorporation of forces into our problems 
 I found it interesting that there was a lot of confusion on some of the top hat questions. Normally the majority does go for one specific answer, but in a lot of the questions today, it was a little all over.
 I liked the part used the sausages or something as weights. Even though I got that problem wrong, I though just the objects made it more interesting. Although I wish we had a little more time to answer the questions, but I understand that he’s trying to do things in a short amount of time. I also found the scale part interesting when the scale only actually reads the normal force.
 the zero-g examples
 I liked the spaceship questions. They really helped me understand relative motion. I think I need to review the concepts though.
 The problem that you had to determine F2 from F1 and a, it’s showcased the relationship between net force, mass, and acceleration pretty well.
 The reference frames and how they affect things 
 when you jump up on a scale (it like in the Wii fit obstacle course bc it yells at you when you jump)
 I found Newton’s first law very interesting. Being able to apply real life experiences such as car travel to physics is fun. 
 I enjoyed learned about the use of tenison forces and how they can be applied to any set of objects. 
 I definitely enjoyed the group work
 tension
 I found the free body diagrams interesting. I liked how the x forces and y went to Pythagorean the magnitude.
 Using free body diagrams 
 Working in break out rooms to solve problems
 net forces were interesting and made sense when adding vectors
 I found it interesting that the tension in a rope, of under the right circumstances, is the same throughout the rope.
 I enjoyed beginning to understand net force, and how friction, normal force, and weight relate to an object.
 The conceptual questions were most interesting because they have real world applications in each example that allow the concept to be clearly visualized. 
 I found the top hat group question interesting because when I finished the problem I realized it was like the vector subtraction problems we did in the past.
 Free body diagrams and how force pairs affect tension
 I enjoyed thinking about tension in the tug of war example because it showed direct real world application that can be visualized
 Tension and force pairs because I didn’t learn a whole lot about force pairs in high school.
 The boat free body diagram was interesting because it explained a real world example.
 I found the description of Newton’s Laws of Motion most interesting.
 Tension in a rope is the same everywhere 
 I thought it was interesting to call the force due to gravity “weight”. We always called it simply “gravity” 
 I enjoyed learning about Newton’s Laws of motion and seeing examples for each of them.
 The intricate descriptions of tension and how it is the same throughout the rope was interesting.
 I found inertial reference frames most interesting in this lecture and how they compare to non inertial reference frames.
 I really enjoyed the way you explained the free body diagrams 
 An object can have many different forces acting on it, but the net force can still be zero
 I found the monkey experiment very interesting. Added a layer of concept behind the math. 
 free body diagrams make sense to me because it is easy to draw the lines and i am familiar with them already
 I thought the relationship between force and mass and acceleration was interesting.","Many students enjoyed the top-hat questions, specifically the ones highlighting tension.

tension
I found the free body diagrams interesting. I liked how the x forces and y went to Pythagorean the magnitude.
Using free body diagrams
Working in break out rooms to solve problems
net forces were interesting and made sense when adding vectors
I found it interesting that the tension in a rope, of under the right circumstances, is the same throughout the rope.
I enjoyed beginning to understand net force, and how friction, normal force, and weight relate to an object.
The conceptual questions were most interesting because they have real world applications in each example that allow the concept to be clearly visualized.
I found the top hat group question interesting because when I finished the problem I realized it was like the vector subtraction problems we did in the past.
Free body diagrams and how force pairs affect tension
I enjoyed thinking about tension in the tug of war example because it showed direct real world application that can be visualized
Tension and force pairs because I didn't learn a whole lot about force pairs in high school.
The boat free body diagram was interesting because it explained a real world example.
I found the description of Newton's Laws of Motion most interesting.
Tension in a rope is the same everywhere
I thought it was interesting to call the force due to gravity “weight”. We always called it simply “gravity”
I enjoyed learning about Newton's Laws of motion and seeing examples for each of them.
The intricate descriptions of tension and how it is the same throughout the rope was interesting.
I found inertial reference frames most interesting in this lecture and how they compare to non inertial reference frames.
I really enjoyed the way you explained the free body diagrams
An object can have many different forces acting on it, but the net force can still be zero
I found the monkey experiment very interesting. Added a layer of concept behind the math.
free body diagrams make sense to me because it is easy to draw the lines and i am familiar with them already
I thought the relationship between force and mass and acceleration was interesting.","FBD
I thought some the practice problems were great today, they were a perfect pretty challenging. I also thought that there were some funny comments made during lecture just about the subject and it kep me engaged
what was most interesting was the examples that we had in class. they were helpful 
I found the idea of tension interesting, and how it is the same no matter were you look at the “rope”
Tension
I liked the alien and spaceship top hat question that depends on your reference and how it can relate to being in a car.
Free body diagrams, force problems in general, complex problems, free body diagrams
I love the conceptual topics of Newton's Laws. I especially found tension interesting. 
I found the tension problems to be the most interesting because I was able to understand them more after the lecture. 
The thing that I found most interesting in today's lecture was the practice problem that required us to find the second force acting on the object.
 The thing I found most interesting in today's lecture was the top hate questions especially when we learned about jumping on a scale that our weight increases 
 I found most of the top hat questions interesting and I feel like they help solidify the concepts that we are going over 
 I found how tension is the same in the whole rope to be interesting. 
 How the wrench in the spaceship keeps moving in the same direction as long as nothing acts upon it. All the problems that went along with the wrench
 I thought it was cool that as long as the pulley is frictionless, it doesn't affect tension. 
 Top hot conceptual questions
 Top hat
 Reference frames were very interesting in class today. It was fun solving those problems
 I enjoyed the amount of conceptual questions today. This gauged my understanding of forces as well as Newton's laws.
 The tension problems, especially the part with all the salami. 
 The spaceship questions and the tug of war question because they were fun to imagine 
 The tug of rope scenario. This was interesting because the tension between the two pullers depends on both not just the stronger one.
 The tension on the string which holds two salamis will still equal to 10n
 In today's video, I found the tension in the ham and tug-o-war the most interesting. It was cool to find out that the tension is the same for the hams
 How tension is the same across the entire string regardless of length.
 I thought the problem with the two pieces of meat hanging by the rope connected to the spring scale was a good way for me to understand the concept of tension
 I found the example problems very helpful. They help reinforce my understand about the material 
 I really enjoyed the tension/Newton's 3rd Law problems. They're tricky and confusing, but I think with a little more practice they can be fun for me. 
 Starting the incorporation of forces into our problems 
 I found it interesting that there was a lot of confusion on some of the top hat questions. Normally the majority does go for one specific answer, but in a lot of the questions today, it was a little all over.
 I liked the part used the sausages or something as weights. Even though I got that problem wrong, I though just the objects made it more interesting. Although I wish we had a little more time to answer the questions, but I understand that he's trying to do things in a short amount of time. I also found the scale part interesting when the scale only actually reads the normal force.
 the zero-g examples
 I liked the spaceship questions. They really helped me understand relative motion. I think I need to review the concepts though.
 The problem that you had to determine F2 from F1 and a, it's showcased the relationship between net force, mass, and acceleration pretty well.
 The reference frames and how they affect things 
 when you jump up on a scale (it like in the Wii fit obstacle course bc it yells at you when you jump)
 I found Newton's first law very interesting. Being able to apply real life experiences such as car travel to physics is fun. 
 I enjoyed learned about the use of tenison forces and how they can be applied to any set of objects.

I think the decrease and increase in voltage and charge is interesting.
I like solving the equations for potential energy and capacitance. the conceptual questions were fun and it made capacitance more clear.
How distance affects voltage and energy
I think it's interesting that when the book touched one of the parallel plates in a demonstration, it affected the voltage.
I really enjoyed the live demonstrations. These definitely increased my understanding of the concepts being taught.
The best/most common capacitors are the simplest ones (parallel plates)
I found the relation between distance and capacitance interesting. It was hard to understand in the reading but your example made it easy and interesting to understand
I liked the last question about the paper dielectric
The sheet of paper vs. the book was interesting and watching the voltage change in the example.
I thought it was interesting that capacitors could be applied to more than just the normal layout and could be cylindrical as well
Demonstrating how voltage in a parallel plate capacitor changes as other values are changed was very interesting
I found it was interesting that by putting work into the system, you can increase the potential energy.

I really appreciate you telling people to be quiet. It helped with my understanding. I can concentrate more. I also really liked the demos in class.
 I enjoyed that the class was quiet and I could hear lecture. I found the demo with charging the capacitor to be an interesting way of showing how capacitors work.
 The voltage demonstration
 I liked the demonstration showing you increasing the distance and voltage going up. I was confused on the Tophat with that and the demonstration made perfect sense.
 expanding the distance and the effect on voltage
 how the sparks reduced the voltage immeaditely
 Today I found it interesting to see the capacitors work and the meter going up and down and we manipulated the variables in the equation that affect the value of C.
 How the distance is affected by dielectric strength 
 How increasing distance between plates, increased the voltage. 
 I found the demonstration with the parallel plate capacitor and corresponding voltage measurement to be interesting
 The demo with a book as a dielectric through two parallel plates
 the example with the two metals plates and moving them close together and then farther apart 
 The arcing demo where you made a spark by charging the capacitor to the point of 3 kV/mm.

 I liked the in class notes about each kind of problem we could encounter. It simplified things and made it easier to understand how to attack certain problems.
 I found most interesting was being able to adjust the ring of electrons using magnetism. 
 The application of the magnetic force and the problem we did in class. 
 I found the in-class experiment where Professor Nero had the metal rod move on the metal tracks. It was interesting because it relates to how ray guns work
 I thoguht the demonstrations were really interesting and showed how strong magnetic fields are.
 I found the most interesting how the concept of moving a rod across rails by sending current through the rail while in an electric field is similar to that of a rail gun.
 Loops have no net force in a uniform magnetic field
 Electrons that can be shown in a coil
 I thought the bending of the beam with current was quite cool
 I found the demonstration interesting with the magnetic field bending the blue line of electrons
 I found the demonstration of magnetic force causing an initially stationary rod to roll in one direction to be interesting.
 Magnetism is just interesting in general
 I found the in class demonstrations particularly the copper pipe demonstration. 
 Direction is flipped because electrons are negative
 The directions/hand rules is interesting.
 The magnet demonstrations are always really neat
 Force on a wire example
 The demonstration
 The magnetic field demo where it bended the electrons. 
 The electron shifts to right which is magnetic field direction
 The concept of associating direction with Magnetism. It is very difficult to conceptualize but very interesting to learn about 
 I enjoyed equating electric force and magnetic force in one of the problems. that was quite interesting.
 The demonstrations
 the demonstrations 
 Seeing the light bend and seeing the current change was exciting and interesting ",There seems to be no confusion related to the material covered in class. Students really enjoyed the in-class demonstrations and examples. They also enjoyed working with magnetism and electrons. I would suggest doing more demonstrations in the future.,I found the demonstration of magnetic force causing an initially stationary rod to roll in one direction to be interesting. |_| I thoguht the demonstrations were really interesting and showed how strong magnetic fields are. |_| The application of the magnetic force and the problem we did in class. |_| The electron shifts to right which is magnetic field direction |_| Direction is flipped because electrons are negative,"In-Class Demonstrations

The fact that flux is out=in -> 2
That if there is no charge at a certain location there is no flux there at all, unlike Electric field and force  -> 3
It was helpful and interesting to see the 3d box problem -> 3
Finding the flux in the y direction was interesting cause I got it wrong at first then realized what I did wrong -> 3
You can solve calc 3 integrals without having to integrate -> 5
How the flux can change based on the side.  -> 3
I really enjoyed solving the first integration problem. I was confused about it first but that problem clarified my confusion.  -> 4
the flux equation -> 3
I found that only needing to consider the electric field component that is perpendicular to dA the most interesting. It's like how you feel more resistance in a water current if you're holding a flat piece of metal with the surface facing the current rather than perpendicular to it. -> 4
I found it interesting to do another integral problem because it shows how the integration formula is used in many different scenarios and helps me to visualize how the components cancel on different shapes.  -> 3
The concept of flux -> 3
I found it interesting that the y component canceled out when doing the example with the charge on a semi-circle. This makes these types of questions much easier to compute. -> 3
I felt like todays class helped me understand some of the concepts I have been struggling with. I really liked how we did more examples that were walked through than clicker questions. -> 4
I liked solving for the flux on the cube and comparing the sides. It helped me understand the concept better. -> 2
I liked the last tophat question.  -> 2
Calculating flux me when it is zero -> 3
I found the beginning of class to be interesting. I found it very helpful to do an example of integrating and setting up the integral. It was reinforcement to my understanding of the electric field concept. -> 3
I think the multiple choice is interesting, and i understand all of it. -> 4
The cube flux example was interesting and very clearly explained  -> 4
the final cube question -> 3
doing the example of extended charge distributions and setting up an integral to solve for the electric field was interesting. -> 5
I liked that you took the time to redo an electric field integration problem so that we could understand it better. -> 5
The mentioning of vector was interesting when discussing of flux  -> 1
The example of the cube with the flux integral.  -> 2
I found the initial example of calculating electric field emitted by a charged half circle interesting.  -> 5
the concept of electric flux was interesting for the reason that I can see it expanding to a much bigger concept of how we measure electricity traveling though wires and it is just the tip of the ice berg -> 3
It was interesting learning about flux and looking at charges with fields around them and how they relate -> 2
Finding E at a point -> 3
the first example of integration showing the whole process again  -> 2
I found the tophat problem the most interesting -> 2
Electric flux is an interesting concept in and of itself -> 3
Learning the different paths flux can take and how it changes the net flux. -> 2
I thought the connection between flux and velocity was interesting. As well as the fact that flux can be calculated from other things other than electricity. -> 4
I found it interesting how electric flux only takes into account the charge that is enclosed in the system (qenclosed). -> 3

Finding the flux in the y direction was interesting cause I got it wrong at first then realized what I did wrong
You can solve calc 3 integrals without having to integrate
How the flux can change based on the side. 
I really enjoyed solving the first integration problem. I was confused about it first but that problem clarified my confusion. 
the flux equation
I found that only needing to consider the electric field component that is perpendicular to dA the most interesting. It's like how you feel more resistance in a water current if you're holding a flat piece of metal with the surface facing the current rather than perpendicular to it.
 I found it interesting to do another integral problem because it shows how the integration formula is used in many different scenarios and helps me to visualize how the components cancel on different shapes. 
 The concept of flux
 I found it interesting that the y component canceled out when doing the example with the charge on a semi-circle. This makes these types of questions much easier to compute.
 I felt like todays class helped me understand some of the concepts I have been struggling with. I really liked how we did more examples that were walked through than clicker questions.
 I liked solving for the flux on the cube and comparing the sides. It helped me understand the concept better.
 I liked the last tophat question. 
 Calculating flux me when it is zero
 I found the beginning of class to be interesting. I found it very helpful to do an example of integrating and setting up the integral. It was reinforcement to my understanding of the electric field concept.
 I think the multiple choice is interesting, and i understand all of it.
 The cube flux example was interesting and very clearly explained 
 the final cube question

 doing the example of extended charge distributions and setting up an integral to solve for the electric field was interesting.
 I liked that you took the time to redo an electric field integration problem so that we could understand it better.
 The mentioning of vector was interesting when discussing of flux 
 The example of the cube with the flux integral. 
 I found the initial example of calculating electric field emitted by a charged half circle interesting. 
 the concept of electric flux was interesting for the reason that I can see it expanding to a much bigger concept of how we measure electricity traveling though wires and it is just the tip of the ice berg
 It was interesting learning about flux and looking at charges with fields around them and how they relate
 Finding E at a point
 the first example of integration showing the whole process again 
 I found the tophat problem the most interesting
 Electric flux is an interesting concept in and of itself
 Learning the different paths flux can take and how it changes the net flux.
 I thought the connection between flux and velocity was interesting. As well as the fact that flux can be calculated from other things other than electricity.
 I found it interesting how electric flux only takes into account the charge that is enclosed in the system (qenclosed).
 drawings
 Negative flux means the electric field lines are going into the enclosed object
 The problem we worked on together as a class 
 I found the integrals to be really interesting and simplifying the problems
 I found the face that the electric flux is dependent on the enclosed charge interesting because it can be applied on different scales (large or small). I also found this especially interesting in cases where charge is not present.","In this lecture, students learned about flux and electric fields and how they interact. They used integration in their example problems, and some students were particularly intrigued by the problem involving the flux of a cube. Students were intrigued by flux in general.","I thought the connection between flux and velocity was interesting.
