I thought that the write up on pigeons and their data sending capabilities was a really cool topic to read up on. -> 3
The guest speaker -> 2
the examples that were given -> 2
What I found interesting in todays class was how birds could transmit data faster than some methods we have nowadays because of the amount of storage that can fit in such a small space -> 4
I really enjoyed discussing the IAPoC system. I love pigeons. It was also interesting discussing the different types of data transfer in both a digital and biological sense. -> 4
I thought that sharing the medium was interesting. -> 3
All of the different ways different animals communicate with one another. -> 3
Comparisons -> 2
I found the different examples using Alice pretty interesting. -> 3
The ways that the ants communicated -> 3
I found the multiplexing interesting because I've dabbled in networks before and learning about the origins was interesting. -> 4
I liked discussing the real world examples involving computational communication like with Amazon -> 4
I found the part with communications for humans to be most interesting. It allowed me to further understand the lesson by relating to something we all do.  -> 4
Wasnt super interesting to be honest -> 1
NA -> 1
The common themes among all communication processes.  -> 3
The Shannon connection  -> 2
learning about how these methods of communication related to biology -> 3
I found learning about IPOAC was pretty interesting. I liked how that example tied in with the various subtopics like multiplexing and latency. -> 4
I liked learning about the bees and the communication between them and how the ants communicated too -> 3
It was interesting to learn about some of the key ideas of communication through an example of the postal system. The terms that related to communication was more understandable because the examples were from the mailing system. -> 4
Pigeons being able to carry terabytes of data is incredible and was shocked when I found out that it's faster in raw bandwidth than human engineered devices -> 4
The pigeons -> 2
Talking about how computer science used ants for research on how stuff should work -> 3
Probably the way multiplexing works and what a browser does to load a page. -> 3
The use of pigeons -> 2

I found the list of topics I will be learning in the class this semester the most interesting.","Nothing. The intro material today was very straight forward, clear, and descriptive.
Before I asked about it, the grading policy about 15% of participation points was slightly convoluted way in communicating that 15% of your participation points will be returned to you. Thank you for using an example in your answer, it clarified things for me effectively.
Is the grading system going to be weighted?
I thought that everything in class today was concise and well said. I wasn't confused about anything. Everything was laid out good.
The brief overview of the major topics of this course seemed pretty interesting. I guess I'm looking forward to learning math through logical and critical thinking.
Since today was an introductory day, I think that everything that was discussed in class was clear and relatively easy to understand. I left the class feeling like I know what needs to be done in order to be prepared for the next class. 
I think the syllabus was explained well, but I might need a couple of days to get it 100% in action and such. 
Homework vs Assigned recitations. 
Nothing really! Today was chill with the syllabus and I think I really got to understand the structure of the class
I think the topic of academic dishonesty and what does and does not count as academic dishonesty could have been discussed further in class today.
 Nothing just an intro to the course. Instructor was extremely clear and concise no complaints 
 Nothing, everything about the syllabus was very clear. ","In this lecture students felt that going over the syllabus was good and it cleared their confusion, however there are some who are still confused about the weight/grading policy. Students also required further explanation on what is considered academic dishonesty. Also more clairfication on the difference between homework and assigned recitations.

The most common aspect that students found confusing was the special cases of tree traversal. There were also some students who had some questions about restricting access, binary nodes, and coding for binary trees.

I liked meeting up with my teammates and talking about when we should meet up with each other. -> 1
I liked going into the breakout groups, my group was alot more talkative and helpful compared to other groups i was in in the past. I liked getting to manuplite the graphs in excel, although it took us awhile to figure out how to do it correctly -> 2
What we learned in Excel was really cool when we could figure out what to do. -> 3

I found it interesting how you could use mathematical models for many different items. -> 2
I’m excited to learn about the function of the dam. -> 2
I enjoyed working it breakout rooms, i feel like my team got a good start on the next project. -> 4
what Ph stood for in engineering -> 3
Again I enjoy getting time to work on projects with my team for a long time it gives us time to get ahead incase something comes up in the future. -> 5
The topic I found the most interesting was the conversation about the perimeter about shapes. -> 4
The new process of analyzing data. -> 3
I found interesting the fact that aporoximating is valued in areas such as engineering -> 4
I found the application of different types of models in different ways to be very interesting. -> 4
I found the mathematical models of data interesting in today’s class -> 4
I found it interesting that it is possible to calculate the power generated from water flow. -> 3
I liked learning more about the Taum Sauk Reservoir and how it works today -> 2
I enjoy creating mathematical representations of the dataset based off of the visual shapes and figures that we saw. It is interesting how various equations can be made for the same model. -> 4
The relationship between finding different types of representations for the surface area and volume of the taum sauk reservoir was interesting to me. -> 3
The in class activity was very interesting -> 4
I enjoyed learning about the numerical models. -> 3
How the hydropower works and analyze them -> 2
I liked how we are finally doing calculations that engineers would do and modeling things like the upper Taum Sauk reservoir because it is interesting and fun -> 3
I enjoyed making the models a lot! -> 4
Figuring out models was pretty interesting. -> 1
I thought the use of google earth to get measurements of the reservoir was interesting. -> 4
The breakout rooms were very interesting and fun! -> 4
I found the puzzle of finding the equation for finding the perimeter of the series of shapes very interesting and fun. I would like to do more things like that in the future because I love puzzles. -> 3
I found the information about modeling, the different kinds of modeling, and laminar modeling interesting. -> 3
How simple shapes can relate to surface area for a random place. Also that Google earth is a useful tool. -> 4
Working in small groups for most of class is nice because it is easier to participate. -> 3
The concept of using data over time in excel to calculate the volume of a whole reservoir is an interesting process that I will be interested to explore in the assignment. -> 2
I found the idea of the Taum Sauk project to be interesting as it isn’t just creating things, rather identifying how the system works and why it was built. -> 5
I found drawing the diagram and calculating the differences in height for each reservoir to be most interesting. -> 2
I found interesting how there’s so much behind  a hydroelectric dam. So much math which is quite interesting on my end. -> 4
The time to work on A10 was helpful -> 4
I liked the amount of time we spent in breakout rooms working on our assignment, and after knowing what to do, it was very interesting. -> 4
The most interesting thing was deciding what simple shapes to use to model the Reservoir. -> 3
The taum sauk reservoir project and the mathematicsl models are a new way of looking at things for me -> 5
That making a mode is important -> 3
Breakout room is always interesting -> 3
I found the most interesting part of today’s class was developing a model. It was cool to see exactly how to do that and then make a mathematical model out of a visual one. -> 3
I found the different ways to solve for perimeter on the example in the slides to be interesting. I liked hearing how other people felt about approaching the problem -> 2
Working with our teams was interesting because we divided up work and collaborated with eachother. -> 4
I enjoyed learning about mathematical models, as well as the part where we came up with our own equations to find the perimeters of shapes. -> 4

 I found it interesting how long we worked in our breakout rooms today.
 starting the assignment 10 with out teams 
 I found that the in class activity was interesting when calculating the pressure height of the reservoir. 
 I found the depth and the diagram of the reservoir interesting 
 The shapes exercise 
 The different ways to find perimeter of irregular shapes 
 working with my group was nice
 nothing that interesting.
 That reservoir is cool. I would like to learn more about it snd how it creates energy
 I enjoyed working on the team project and getting a chance to work ahead with my group. ",Students enjoyed the Tom Sauk reservoir activity and how it allowed them to practically use mathematical modeling. The students also enjoyed working in groups and being able to work on Assignment 10 in class.,I thought that the mathematical modeling with perimeters Of shapes was interesting and fun  |_| I found that spending more time with our break out groups was helpful for working through any confusion |_| Finding the volume for the reservoir was interesting because we are applying our math knowledge to a real life situation |_| It was fun and interesting using google earth to map the surface area of the reservoir. |_| The time to work on A10 was helpful,"Mathematical Modeling

i love this project
Due dates were informative
I found the prototype ideas interesting
The 3D modeling
working on the prototypes in the different softwares
How to use cad
The most interesting part was starting to work on our final ideas!!
Building prototype
I thought the prototyping was interesting
I enjoyed Jeff's costume
I liked Jeff's Robin costume.
I found it interesting how we make prototypes with cad."," nothing
I like our project 
I really liked this aspect of the project where we model and test our different ideas
The most interest part of today's class was learning about the different ways to prototype our solutions.  
I thought the prototyping methods were interesting. I am excited to try them for my self.
I found it interesting how there are so many softwares available to make pro types on!
This is a long project, so I like how we're looking back on what we've done so far. This may give us a better understanding of how we'll move forward.
The time to work with our teams in break out rooms
I found it interesting that purdue gives access to lots of tools to help with prototyping.
I liked how much time we got to work on our new assignment.
I thought that coming up with ways to make our prototypes without having cards to many materials was actually really fun to do
 Thinking of what ideas we would turn into prototypes 
 I found the generating ideas for prototypes to be most interesting as I could be creative and think of many possible solutions.
 Breakout room
 The most interesting think in class to day was Jeff's very cool costume for Halloween. 
 Talking about prototyping was interesting and how they can help. 
 how to access the cad software 
 I found interesting how we have a 3D printing club where we could use their resources for our project. Also the amounts of available software programs offered by Purdue.
 I found it interesting just how many different ways creating a diagram is and how helpful it can be. 
 I love CAD. I am very happy to be using CAD in this class.

 I found it interesting how we make prototypes with cad. ","While some students struggled with aspects of prototyping, students also found it interesting. The same is tru for CAD and 3D modeling software. Students also liked working on the project and in their teams. Also, it should be noted that many students like Jeff's Robin costume. This might be a good thing to keep in mind when it comes to relating to the students.","This is a long project, so I like how we're looking back on what we'vedone so far.

 The taum Sauk failure and other engineering failures that have occurred
 I found that the engineering failures to be most interesting. In particular I found the deep water horizon spill and bhopal explosion to be particularly interesting as they had long term environmental impacts. I wanted to mention the hyatt regency walkway collapse but we ran out of time.
 I liked going over different engineering failures.
 I found the number of engineering failures to be the most interesting thing in today’s class. There are so many preventable errors that have occurred and other things need to be done to make sure errors like this in engineering practices do not happen again. 
 I found the information about the engineering failures to be very interesting. It was fun that people participated and gave examples of failures that they knew of. 
 We talked about the questions and there was an open discussion for certain questions. It was interesting hearing everyone’s different examples because some of them I didn’t know or think about.
 The most interesting part of class was talking about why the Taum Sauk Reservoir failed.
 I found the different engineering errors of the Taum Sauk Reservoir interesting. 
 The analysis of the failure of the taum sauk reservoir
 I found interesting how we talked about the different errors within some engineering designs. There were multiple failures that could’ve been preventable but now we know what not to do. 
 I liked how we got so much time to work on our A12 assignment. It helps to be on the same page as our team and we were also able to ask questions about the upcoming exam.
 The engineering reasons behind the failure of the Taum Sauk Reservoir.
 Todays class was very interesting, because we discussed the various engineering failures throughout history.
 Learning about engineering failures was interesting
 The time spent in breakout rooms with my team are super helpful. We are able to get through a lot of project material in the given time.
 I really liked the amount of time we got for team work and the discussion about engineering mistakes.
 Engineering failures 
 I found the reason why the Tatum Sauk failed to be very interesting and I had a lot of fun looking at why it failed
 The many engined failures that have occurred in the past and how many mistakes are repeated. 
 It was interesting to learn the reasons of the filure and to watch the video of the dam being rebuilt
 The breach in the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 I found the information and discussion about engineering failures was very interesting today.
 Talking about the different engineering failures over the years was the most interesting part to me.
 working on the report withy team
 I found the power equation and solving for power interesting. I also enjoy learning about engineering disasters in history
 I found it interesting to look into engineering failures. It was cool to see that engineering is very important for health and safety of everyday civilians.
 I found learning about engineering failures most interesting about the class 
 I liked learning about the errors that occur in the engineering field!
 I am glad that hear about the practice exam! And we are allowed to work on breakout room about our project.
 The engineering failures were cool because they were real events
 I found it interesting that engineers careless mistakes caused the Taum Sauk failure.
 The failure of the dam was interesting 
 Figuring out the components of the failure of the Taum Saul Reservoir
 I enjoyed talking about engineering disasters to see how we have improved over time.
 The engineering error examples where cool. 
 I liked learning about histortical engineering failures
 The breakout time with a ta was helpful today. 
 I found the amount of time we had in breakout rooms good, and the information about the exam was very helpful!
 looking at why the taum sauk failed
 working with teammates on A12
 I found the engineering failures interesting because they are real world examples. 
 Working with the power formula
 I thought it was interesting how errors could help us design better things.
 I liked seeing the different examples of engineering gone wrong
 How to calculate flow rate 
 The engineering failure in design
 I enjoyed researching why the Taum Sauk Reservoir failed","A vast majority of the students found the engineering failure topic interesting in this class. They also specifically highlighted the Tom Sauk reservoir in many of their statements. Some other students mentioned that they continue to enjoy the breakout rooms and working with their teams, as well as learning about mathematical modeling and using equations to calculate properties.",I liked seeing the different examples of engineering gone wrong  mathematical modeling is still really interesting problem solving.  The time spent in breakout rooms with my team are super helpful. We areable to get through a lot of project material in the given time.

I found the information about the engineering failures to be very interesting. It was fun that people participated and gave examples of failures that they knew of.
We talked about the questions and there was an open discussion for certain questions. It was interesting hearing everyone's different examples because some of them I didn't know or think about.
The most interesting part of class was talking about why the Taum Sauk Reservoir failed.
I found the different engineering errors of the Taum Sauk Reservoir interesting.
The analysis of the failure of the taum sauk reservoir
I found interesting how we talked about the different errors within some engineering designs. There were multiple failures that could've been preventable but now we know what not to do.
I liked how we got so much time to work on our A12 assignment. It helps to be on the same page as our team and we were also able to ask questions about the upcoming exam.
The engineering reasons behind the failure of the Taum Sauk Reservoir.
Todays class was very interesting, because we discussed the various engineering failures throughout history.

I found it interesting how many engineering fails there have been yet we continue to learn from them and improve. 
The examples of engineering failures
I found that discussing the errors in different situations very interesting. This is because I heard about one I knew and other I didn't know about. 
mathematical modeling is still really interesting problem solving. wish we had more time.
I found the explanation and discussion of past and possible engineering failures and how to prevent them was the most interesting part of today's class.
I found the conversation on preventable mistakes very important because these mistakes affect people's lives or, in extreme cases, take them.
I liked getting to work in breakout rooms, i feel like we have a good amount of work done for the a12 project
It was interesting to research how the Taum Sauk reservoir broke and how much was wrong with it.

I didn’t think anything was confusing in class today. I am pretty familiar with excel so it wasn’t much of a challenge for me, and I was able to help out others with figuring out how to get the data from CoGo into excel. -> 1
I feel like for how much we used excel in today’s lesson, it really needed to be explained better. Not many people knew how to fix the problem, and for learning how to use it, it would have been better to do it in a big lecture where we could follow a long with the professor and have our questions answered. I think the Problem Scoping could have been explained better too. -> 5
Excel practice at the end was confusing because we didn’t have much time -> 4
Downloading the file and getting the proper form -> 2
I was a little confused on how to properly fill out Assignment 03 as it was not discussed. I was still also confused by the end of class what exactly was due when. -> 3
I was a little confused today when we where downloading the file from online and making it available to use on excel.  I think we could have slowed down there a little bit to make sure all of the students are on the same page and are able to open up the spreadsheet without any errors. -> 3
The only thing I found confusing today was the formula input for the gravitational forces calculation. However, I ended up figuring it out by altering the scientific notation cells. -> 3
I was really confused on what the Problem Statement was supposed to be about. I didn’t really understand what problem needed to be solved, and much less what solution I should come up with to solve it. -> 4
I was very stressed during class because Excel was not working and I felt the time in the break out rooms was too short. Also the data represents measurements was very confusing. -> 5
I think that the problem statement needed some more explaining. I feel like I had a general idea of what I needed to accomplish however I almost felt lost like I didn’t know exactly what I was doing when constructing my problem statement. -> 3
I was confused about entering the complex calculations into excel. I haven’t used excel in a long time so I think I just need practice. -> 3
Excel stuff was confusing and the problem statement -> 3
Some of the instructions for the in class activities were a little unclear. -> 3
I found it confusing when I tried to download the data sheet to excel. I also was kicked from the zoom call and had trouble getting back in to the call. -> 4
Everything was properly explained in this meeting. -> 1

How to access the excel file. I couldn’t get it to open but then we eventually figured it out so it was good! -> 3
Excel was pretty confusing to start, but with the help of the ta’s i was able to calculate the value, but it was 35 instead of 3.5 to whatever value, which was confusing. -> 1
I had a bit of trouble loading the Excel file but I got it figured out. I am still confused about the exact requirements of the problem statement. -> 2
I felt like I didn’t have enough time to finish the problem statement and my work seemed sloppy to me. -> 2

 Excel was pretty confusing to start, but with the help of the ta’s i was able to calculate the value, but it was 35 instead of 3.5 to whatever value, which was confusing.
 I had a bit of trouble loading the Excel file but I got it figured out. I am still confused about the exact requirements of the problem statement.

The in class assignment was very confusing, I had no idea what to submit into bright space. The presentation slides weren’t put on bright space either. The instructions for what we were supposed to do once in our team groups should be more specific. -> 4
You went very fast when going through excel, and it wasnt super clear as far as what we were supposed to submit. If you could put the slides on brightspace before the video call it would be helpful, because then we could have it open and look at them if we get lost during a call -> 4
I wish that we got some better instructions on what we were supposed to do for the In-Class Activity. My group had a hard time figuring out what to do. -> 5
Pivot tables were sort of rushed through and their uses weren’t fully explained which left my breakout group confused on what to do. -> 3
I think what we were supposed to do with the excel document was a little bit confusing.  The directions weren’t super specific and I thank the assignment should have been clarified a little better. -> 2
A more in depth explanation of PivotTables. My whole group did not know how to answer the in class assignment. The videos before class helped explain this but did not explain it in its entirety. -> 3
Maybe more about the team project? And the bike project too. -> 2
I was confused about the in-class assignment and what needed to be submitted on the excel document. -> 3
The amount of time spent during class explaining the different data types could use some lengthening. -> 3
I think everything was quite clear. I just need to get more comfortable with excel. -> 1
nothing except how to filter properly -> 3
doing excel, specifically the pivot chart was confusing -> 3
Very little. I would have likes more time spent in the groups, but I assume that we’ll get more of that further into the project. -> 1
I had a hard time saving my excel document with the graph on it. It kept saying I could not save it because it had multiple files. -> 4
How to use pivot tables and making graphs from them. -> 4
I was confused by how we were supposed to organize the central tendency information in the excel document. -> 3
I was lost on the in class excel activity today. I could not figure out how to find the outliers for the birth year. -> 5
Everything was explained enough, except for the due date of the bike share project and a mention of CAD. -> 2
The class went smoothly except for the amount of time I had to work on excel. I have limited experience with excel so just more review on that would be great. -> 2
I was confused on what the task is for assignment 5 and how we need to use the bike share data to complete the assignment. -> 4
What we are supposed to do with the outliers -> 2
the class participation activity -> 3
I’m just confused on what each platform we are using is for. We have so many and I just want to know their purpose. -> 2
The Excel sheets are still confusing to me. It’s hard to locate and place everything that is needed. The steps can get a little tricky as well. -> 5
What information needed to be submitted on excel when looking for the outliers was a little confusing. -> 2
how to submit our outliers into bright space( what form was acceptable) -> 2
I was confused in today’s class because we were given somewhat vague instructions on how to submit the in class participation assignment because we were just submitting a response (which could have been done in a word document or directly on bright space)but we also needed a visual even if we did not use a graph(which would have required the spreadsheet). -> 2
I didn’t find anything very confusing today for class except for the fact that I was kicked from the Zoom call due to internet issues. -> 2
In the breakout rooms we rhiught we had to start working on assignment 5 instead of 4. I also didn’t understand very well what we have ti submit in the excel spreadsheet. Like I don’t know if we just have to submit our Pivot Table or just the date or what -> 5
Today’s class went very smoothly. I am confused why the professor jumped to Assignment 4 and 5 when most people did not submit looking at data yet. -> 2
I think that the amount of assignments we have is a little confusing and I wish there was a list of all of them with dates that I could check off as I complete them. -> 2
The class wasn’t confusing today except for maybe a stronger explanation of directions for the overall objective of the assignment or where we are supposed to go for the assignments. -> 2
I think that the most confusing part in today’s class was the pivot tables. I have been using excel extensively for over a year but i never used pivot tables so it may take me some time to get used to the pivot tables but as of now they seem somewhat confusing. -> 2
The instructions for the descriptive statistics activity weren’t very clear and I wasn’t sure how to present what I found. -> 3
Most of the stuff explained today was pretty clear! I wasn’t able to get slack though so it would be nice if we were sent the link on bright space or email as well! -> 2
My group and I had a little bit of trouble knowing exactly what you wanted us to do with the information in the excel spreadsheet. We ended up submitting some things we had created but weren’t sure on what you wanted. -> 3
The assignment was kind of confusing. I wasn’t very sure what was expected from us on the pivot table. I was able to find the outliers, average, median and mode, but was confused about the pivot table. -> 3
I didn’t find anything confusing today -> 1
It got a little confusing when we were sent to our breakout groups because I wasn’t very sure what to do. -> 2
Some of the excel information was just grazed over, so it made it somewhat difficult to do what I needed to do in the breakout sessions, but it ended up being okay. -> 2
I wasn't quite clear on what was meant by reformatting data or what a useful format would be. -> 3
I still don’t understand when to use the Slack communication platform. Is it something we should be checking daily or 2-3 times a week? -> 3

The in class assignment was very confusing, I had no idea what to submit into bright space. The presentation slides weren't put on bright space either. The instructions for what we were supposed to do once in our team groups should be more specific. -> 4
You went very fast when going through excel, and it wasnt super clear as far as what we were supposed to submit. If you could put the slides on brightspace before the video call it would be helpful, because then we could have it open and look at them if we get lost during a call -> 4
I wish that we got some better instructions on what we were supposed to do for the In-Class Activity. My group had a hard time figuring out what to do. -> 5

 The assignment was kind of confusing. I wasn't very sure what was expected from us on the pivot table. I was able to find the outliers, average, median and mode, but was confused about the pivot table.
 I didn't find anything confusing today
 It got a little confusing when we were sent to our breakout groups because I wasn't very sure what to do. 
 Some of the excel information was just grazed over, so it made it somewhat difficult to do what I needed to do in the breakout sessions, but it ended up being okay. 
 I wasn't quite clear on what was meant by reformatting data or what a useful format would be.

 I still don't understand when to use the Slack communication platform. Is it something we should be checking daily or 2-3 times a week?
 I do not know what to turn into what module. The modules make it confusing to know what I should be turning in.
 I found nothing confusing today.
 Thought it was a good class, the objectives were clear and I was able to keep up for the most part.
 I think it was a little confusing for some people when doing the excel assignment since some people are still getting used to it and you went a little fast. 
 How much detail we needed to put into the class activity with the finding birth year outliers 
 Some of the in class assignments have unclear instructions.
 Everything was clear.
 I think that some of the info was rushed because of lack of time. I think breakout rooms were too short
 I wasn't very confused in that class. I learned a lot about what the class will be about and what we will learn. ","The students seemed to have the hardest time figuring out what the instructions entailed for this class and its assignments. A lot of discussion regarded Excel and the in-class activity. It might be worth reviewing the instructional material to clear up any misconceptions, and also reviewing pivot tables. Lastly, it seems some students cannot access the slides in Brightspace. Check to make sure they can access them.","If you could put the slides on brightspace before the video call itwould be helpful, because then we could have it open and look at them ifwe get lost during a call |_| I was confused on what the task is for assignment 5 and how we need to use the bike share data to complete the assignment. |_| I think it was a little confusing for some people when doing theexcelassignment since some people are still getting used to it and youwent alittle fast.  |_| The instructions for the descriptive statistics activity weren't very clear and I wasn't sure how to present what I found. |_| How to use pivot tables and making graphs from them.

 Everything seemed straight forward to me. If something seems unclear I will look at the slides or ask questions. 
 We could have used some more information about how to prepare for the exam. In other classes I know there are previous exams that we can use to study.
 I found that during the studio time, I was confused as to whether use a constant pressure head or using a changing one that changes based on the height of the upper reservoir.
 I didn't have any confusion in class today.
 After showing the slide on assignment 10, I know I did the models wrong but it wasn't explained how to do it correctly.
 I was confused as to whether there was an in-class participation assignment 
 There was nothing that confused me during class except for a small part of assignment 12 that my group worked on.
 Nothing comes to mind
 Nothing was very confusing because we didn't do much except go to our breakout rooms.
 It all made sense today!
 If we had an in-class activity 
 Learning about the second half of the Taum Sauk project was a little confusing 
 when assignment A12 is due
 Nothing was really confusing 
 The use of excel for A12 needed for explanation
","There was some confusion over the calculations that were needed in class, specifically the power calculation. There are some students who had questions about the exam and how to prepare for it. There were also students who were concerned about the quizzes, specifically on how they will work. In a similar vein, students were also confused on how Excel will be used for quizzes as well as the assignments. It might be worth going over these aspects of the course before the due dates.","I found that during the studio time, I was confused as to whether use a constant pressure head or using a changing one that changes based on the height of the upper reservoir. |_|  We could have used some more information about how to prepare for the exam.

 I was confused about assignment 18 and the prototypes. ","Students seemed to have some confusion with prototyping. Mainly on how to make start or what was wanted as a final deliverable. This was tied to some issues using CAD, as well as some confusion about the deliverables. There was some confusion about using the weighted matrix, as well.

 One thing that was confusing about today’s class was are you able to use more than 500 solar panels for the library? Or are we just solely supposed to perform calculations based on the idea that we are using 500 solar panels?
 I found nothing to be confusing or unclear in today’s class. Everything was explained well and made clear prior to the given work time. Making sure to explain what was needed and expected for the project helped me gain a better understanding before going into it.
 I was confused on A13 even after reading the instruction on part 4, it included calculations that I didn’t understand where we could get the information from.
 I didn't understand exactly how to  calculate energy conversion
 What was confusing a little bit was determining a way to actually find rates and costs. I understand this will be found through team discussion. 
 Nothing was confusing today.
 Part four of assignment 13 is economic and environmental analysis. I do not know what “total capital investment” is, or what a “payback period” is. In the next class could we briefly go over what these terms mean, as well as an example for how to calculate them. 
 What assignment A13 was about, and when solar energy is more beneficial than other forms of energy production m.
 I thought a CATME survey was assigned but I didn't see it on the website
 A13 has a lot of details that I feel are missing. For example, with the environmental analysis, the instructions aren’t quite clear on what the equation provided is to be used for or what information needs to be found online.
 I was originally confused about what was needed for the in class participation, but then I found it in the chat!
 I wasn’t very confused by anything but I wasn’t positive if we were supposed to cite the conversion website or just put the link. Besides that everything was fine and we just looked over our project.
 I thought it was confusing when we were trying to figure out what exact calculations we needed to do to do an environmental and economic evaluation 
 I did not find anything particularly confusing in todays class.
 Today’s class went very smoothly there wasn’t much confusion to be had the only thing that went fast was just after asking the questions to the class
 Something that was a little confusing was finding the time it would take to payback the investment of the solar panel purchases. 
 The confusing part is how the new assignment is set up. There's no excel file and the memo is rough with info.
 I thought that the discussion of energy and conversions could have used more details during class.
 Thoroughly enjoyed today’s topics and structure.
 Nothing was really confusing.
 The only thing that confused me was the assignment that was assigned today. I did not understand some of the directions, but my team was able to clear that up.
 Nothing, everything was clear 
 The explanation of how solar energy is used to generate power.
 I would have liked some more information on the emissions of Solar Panels and the systems currently used in powering the Indianapolis Library.
 nothing was confusing and it was very straightforward.
 Assignment 13 was slightly confusing, as are most assignments on first glance, due to the large amount of information given.
 Something that was a little confusing in today’s class was the details of the new assignment A13.
 Not much was confusing this lecture, everything was coherent. 
 I was confused when we were asked some of the questions about electricity how you wanted us to answer. 
 Figuring out exactly what needed to be done for assignment 13 was confusing at first. 
 Everything was very clear and cohesive. I understood the new project and we worked on it effectively.
 Nothing was confusing this class and I could perform well during the whole assignment.
 I needed a bit more information on the assignment that is coming up. I’m still a bit confused on what it is asking us to compare and how to calculate the values. 
 I thought some peoples explanations of how energy is generated were inconsistent.
 no
 how solar power works
 I didn’t find anything too confusing 
 There was not many things confusing, so everything was good.
 I was a bit confused on what exactly needs to go into the background information for assignment 13.
 Unsure how to do environmental analysis. I’m not sure where to begin. 
 Nothing was confusing
 Nothing. Everything was pretty clear and the instructions all made sense.
 There were some things in A13 that were unspecified that need to be cleared up. For example, the emissions of the various solar panels 
 Everything was clear and straightforward 
 Nothing was confusing today. everything was well explained and easy to understand.
 Not confusing. New assignment 
 Nothing was confusing
 Nothing much! We read through Assignment 13 and assigned parts to each member of the team. However, if we have questions, we’ll ask our PT.
 Nothing was confusing in today’s class,
 What validates a reliable conversion source. We were asked to find one. but are you looking for a .gov source specifically or just a solid conversion source in general?
 One thing that was confusing was what determines if a site is credible.","The major confusion from this class dealt with Assignment 13. Some students felt that there was not enough information to conduct some of the calculations, or did not understand how to conduct them. Power generation seemed to be a topic that students are having difficulty conceptualizing, especially solar power generation. There were also some concerns about Excel files, or the lack thereof.","I feel like today’s class could’ve used a more in depth explanation ofhow power is produced, we discussed methods of producing power but notactually how the power was produced.

A13 assignment needs clarification
I was confused on what kind of reaserch would be required outside of the information given to us in the assignment document.
Requirements for A13 are very confusing. Do we need to even use natural gas data/will the library still be heated by natural gas while powered by solar panels? Should we assume that solar panels have 0 carbon emissions, or do we need to take into account the carbon emissions caused by the manufacturing process of those panels?

Eventually, after looking online and only finding calculators and stuff I realized that a tool could be a reliable website or a reliable calculator.
I was confused about the exact way electricity was produced because I could see a common principal behind each of the processes. I will do a bit of research to figure this out on my own. I think it will be more clear once I do that.
I didn't find much to be confusing about this lesson.
One thing that was confusing about today's class was are you able to use more than 500 solar panels for the library? Or are we just solely supposed to perform calculations based on the idea that we are using 500 solar panels?
I found nothing to be confusing or unclear in today's class. Everything was explained well and made clear prior to the given work time. Making sure to explain what was needed and expected for the project helped me gain a better understanding before going into it.
I was confused on A13 even after reading the instruction on part 4, it included calculations that I didn't understand where we could get the information from.
I didn't understand exactly how to  calculate energy conversion
What was confusing a little bit was determining a way to actually find rates and costs. I understand this will be found through team discussion.
Nothing was confusing today.
Part four of assignment 13 is economic and environmental analysis. I do not know what “total capital investment” is, or what a “payback period” is. In the next class could we briefly go over what these terms mean, as well as an example for how to calculate them.
What assignment A13 was about, and when solar energy is more beneficial than other forms of energy production m.
I thought a CATME survey was assigned but I didn't see it on the website
A13 has a lot of details that I feel are missing. For example, with the environmental analysis, the instructions aren't quite clear on what the equation provided is to be used for or what information needs to be found online.
I was originally confused about what was needed for the in class participation, but then I found it in the chat!
I wasn't very confused by anything but I wasn't positive if we were supposed to cite the conversion website or just put the link. Besides that everything was fine and we just looked over our project.
I thought it was confusing when we were trying to figure out what exact calculations we needed to do to do an environmental and economic evaluation
I did not find anything particularly confusing in todays class.
Today's class went very smoothly there wasn't much confusion to be had the only thing that went fast was just after asking the questions to the class
Something that was a little confusing was finding the time it would take to payback the investment of the solar panel purchases.
The confusing part is how the new assignment is set up. There's no excel file and the memo is rough with info.
I thought that the discussion of energy and conversions could have used more details during class.
Thoroughly enjoyed today's topics and structure.
Nothing was really confusing.
The only thing that confused me was the assignment that was assigned today. I did not understand some of the directions, but my team was able to clear that up.

how solar power works
I didn't find anything too confusing
There was not many things confusing, so everything was good.
I was a bit confused on what exactly needs to go into the background information for assignment 13.
Unsure how to do environmental analysis. I'm not sure where to begin.
Nothing was confusing
Nothing. Everything was pretty clear and the instructions all made sense.
There were some things in A13 that were unspecified that need to be cleared up. For example, the emissions of the various solar panels

Nothing much! We read through Assignment 13 and assigned parts to each member of the team. However, if we have questions, we'll ask our PT.
Nothing was confusing in today's class,
What validates a reliable conversion source. We were asked to find one. but are you looking for a .gov source specifically or just a solid conversion source in general?
One thing that was confusing was what determines if a site is credible.","I feel like today's class could've used a more in depth explanation of how power is produced, we discussed methods of producing power but not actually how the power was produced.
The details for the next assignment 
There wasn't anything confusing. 
The process by which electricity and power is generated could have been explained a little further.
I didnt comprehend the technicalities behind the energy harnessing processes.
A13 assignment needs clarification
I was confused on what kind of reaserch would be required outside of the information given to us in the assignment document.
Requirements for A13 are very confusing. Do we need to even use natural gas data/will the library still be heated by natural gas while powered by solar panels? Should we assume that solar panels have 0 carbon emissions, or do we need to take into account the carbon emissions caused by the manufacturing process of those panels?
I was happy with today's class. No technological issues and extremely productive. The extended time in breakout rooms was very helpful as well in getting a great head start with A013.

the assignment number 5 -> 3
I felt all the details were clear during this class -> 1
One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. -> 1
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for? -> 2
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel. -> 3
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant. -> 1
Bike share group project. -> 2
The z score was roughly explained -> 3
How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? -> 5
I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost. -> 3
What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn’t know what to do. -> 3
Nothing was confusing today during class -> 1
I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data. -> 3
I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from -> 4
The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better -> 2
The explanation for what to do for assignment 08 -> 3
How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. -> 2
I wasn’t really confused today -> 1
Assignment 5 because we did not go over it. -> 2
The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn’t seem to have much discription. -> 2
I find probability in general confusing. -> 4
I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. -> 3
The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. -> 3
I would’ve appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point. -> 2
Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve. -> 4
Nothing, class was great as usual -> 1
Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation. -> 3
I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. -> 2
Today’s class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation -> 1
Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5? -> 1
I am not sure about exactly what z value does -> 2
Everything went well in today’s class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn’t know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it. -> 1
There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. -> 2
I thought that we could’ve spent a little more time on probability, since it’s what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps. -> 1
Nothing really -> 1
The main confusing part about today’s class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project. -> 3
The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before. -> 3
I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. -> 3
I’m still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. -> 1

I didn’t find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for awhile. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd -> 2
Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6. -> 3

How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. -> 4
The description of assignment 8 was confusing -> 4
Nothing was confusing to me today. -> 1
Nothing was very confusing about today’s class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. -> 4
Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration. -> 3
The way to calculate the curve with integrals. -> 3
Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral) -> 4
I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?) -> 3
The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better. -> 4
What we had to do in class -> 3
It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it. -> 1
The assignments some times are very confusing. We don’t even go through them and the PDFs don’t say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear. -> 3
Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes).

What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity -> 2
I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came -> 5
Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don’t know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using -> 2
I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation -> 1

There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team.
I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
Nothing really
The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides.
I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail.
Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate.
Nothing was confusing for me
submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines.
I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
nothing, everything was clear today
Data types
One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing.
How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining.
The description of assignment 8 was confusing
Nothing was confusing to me today.
Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly.
Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
What we had to do in class
It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
How to organize my data
It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using
I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
Nothing, today was pretty straightforward
The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage?
I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages.","Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?

I was confused about how to submit A10 at the beginning of the lecture because brightspace was being weird. It was explained though.
Nothing in today's class was confusing
For modelling the height and volume can we use alternative mathematical models or is linear equations the only answer. ( My team used summation)
I don't think anything was confusing in the class today, everything was pretty straight forward
The ordeal with the A10 was confusing but eventually got clarified. other than that, the class was fairly straightforward as we spent the rest of the times working in groups on a nearly finished project.
Nothing was confusing in today's class, we had a lot of productive work time!
I want to know more about volumetric flow rate and assignment 12 but it wasn't that confusing
I do not think anything in today's class was particularly confusing
I found nothing confusing about today's class
We had a bit of trouble getting our graph of flow rate to be formatted correctly.
How to find the intervals for time. Should we make a rough estimate based on the graph? Furthermore, if one of our intervals is 0:00-7:00, then should our following interval be 7:00-13:00, or 7:15-13:00
Assignment A12 was introduced during class today, and I found it a little confusing what was expected of us for the assignment. I was able to clear up most of my questions during breakouts though.
Nothing was confusing to me in class today.
There wasn't much confusion with today's lecture. I thought our module quiz was so much easier to comprehend than the last one and make class easy to move through
I think everything was pretty clear today, some info about A12 was left out but I think everything will be ok.
The length of the time periods
I thought nothing was particularly confusing about today because it was mostly a studio day.
The slides showing part 6 were good. I would have liked more clarity for part 7 of the assignment. Other than that class was not confusing today. It was mostly a work day
My team thought we would have a million things to do for assignments and were confused when we didn't.
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how do we determine the potential errors with the different methods of finding the slope of a line?
The turning in of assignment a10, but this was resolved by the end of class well enough
nothing today
There was nothing particularly confusing with today's class. The thing that needed more details was the use of the excel file to find the flow rate.
Everything was clear and well explained in today's class
I feel as though figuring out the power equation and how to calculate volumetric flow rate needed a lot more time.
It would be helpful to learn more about the calculation of the flow rate and what values to use
Calculating power was somewhat confusing because that's the nature of it.
How to find the instantaneous flow rate was something I feel needed more explaining. I was able to understand what it was asking for the flow rate for the sections, but not it's instantaneous flow rate.
Nothing.

I wasn't sure exactly where to start on the assignment 12. My group was very confused when we went to studio time, and we didn't have a pt or gta come into our breakout session to help us out.
I found nothing too confusing in today's class. The only slightly confusing thing was doing conversions for assignment A12.
Finding the instantaneous flow rate is somewhat confusing on excel.
What we needed to do in part 6.a and 6.b

Not much was explained in today's class","I was confused about whether we were supposed to find the distinct time intervals using how the graph looked.
There wasn't anything confusing. 
This lesson seemed more to be of a ""checkup"" and to start us off on assignment 12, so there wasn't really anything new or something I was confused about.

The calculations for the flow rate could have been explained more which would be helpful for A12.
Something that was confusing was details regarding the A10 assignment, but at the end those issues were resolved. 
I was confused as to why the assignment 10 submission didn't work at first for our group, but that's no longer an issue since it was reopened.

We had some questions on Assignment 12, but we got help and sorted it out! Other than that, everything was straightforward and my team and I are currently working on finishing our parts.","I thought that the research was the most difficult since it required me to evaluate sources based on their merit.
It was not very confusing. I found the class pretty straightforward and I did not struggle to comprehend the instructions issued.
Nothing was confusing this class
The majority, if not all the information today was clear to me.
I need more details about the failure
I didn't find much to be confusing this lesson, except for within the class participation activity where we needed to mention something along the lines of ""what engineering professions/actions should be considered in the future"" and what we were supposed to mention. 
I suppose this doesn’t have anything to do with today’s class, but I’m personally confused as to why we can’t use calculators on the test for 6B. If we have access to so many other resources, why couldn’t I check my work on a simple physical calculator? 
The only confusing part about today’s class was figuring out exactly why the Upper Reservoir collapsed, but after some research I figured it out.
I am not sure about if we should us the line of best fit for modeling the volume at the top of the dam. the linear model diverges from the data at the top where accuracy would be most important for calculating the safety. I was considering using a nonlinear model with the Excell regression tools.
The exam procedures are kinda unclear. They were glossed over too quickly.

 I was confused about the exam style and would’ve like more information about the exam but other than that the class itself wasn’t that confusing.
 Something that needed more details was the ways to calculate flow rate in the excel sheet through the two methods. 
 I found the lecture very clear today. Everything made sense because it was explained thoroughly and completely. I know what I am going to do to study for the exam and I am on track with my team for A12.
 Nothing was really confusing besides trying to get all the reasons why the dam failed.
 I was a bit confused about the exact requirements for units of the instantaneous volumetric flow rate, do we need to make sure it is in multiple units?
 The one thing that was confusing about today’s class was how would you go about calculating the efficiency for the power equation?
 Everything was made to be very clear and easy to understand throughout this lecture. The usage of videos and examples to help show engineering failures helped broaden my understanding and helped define engineering failures easier than just giving a standard definition.
 There wasn't anything confusing today. 
 Everything was clear.
 There wasn’t anything confusing in this class, I was just confused by the date if the exam which is entirely my fault I came to class prepared to take it today and was relieved when it on Friday

I did not find anything confusing during today's class.
Nothing was confusing!
Data conversions were confusing. Units were hard to understand for power and the variables of power.
More details about power calculation would be helpful especially with converting units.

We had some questions on Assignment 12, but we got help and sorted it out! Other than that, everything was straightforward and my team and I are currently working on finishing our parts.","I thought that the research was the most difficult since it required me to evaluate sources based on their merit.
It was not very confusing. I found the class pretty straightforward and I did not struggle to comprehend the instructions issued.
Nothing was confusing this class
The majority, if not all the information today was clear to me.
I need more details about the failure
I didn't find much to be confusing this lesson, except for within the class participation activity where we needed to mention something along the lines of ""what engineering professions/actions should be considered in the future"" and what we were supposed to mention. 
I suppose this doesn't have anything to do with today's class, but I'm personally confused as to why we can't use calculators on the test for 6B. If we have access to so many other resources, why couldn't I check my work on a simple physical calculator? 
The only confusing part about today's class was figuring out exactly why the Upper Reservoir collapsed, but after some research I figured it out.
I am not sure about if we should us the line of best fit for modeling the volume at the top of the dam. the linear model diverges from the data at the top where accuracy would be most important for calculating the safety. I was considering using a nonlinear model with the Excell regression tools.
The exam procedures are kinda unclear. They were glossed over too quickly.
 I felt like everything was pretty clear today, but I was a bit confused on what VIIIa) was asking at first on A12. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today's class. 
 What we needed to turn in for the in class assignment.
 I was confused about the exam style and would've like more information about the exam but other than that the class itself wasn't that confusing.
 Something that needed more details was the ways to calculate flow rate in the excel sheet through the two methods. 
 I found the lecture very clear today. Everything made sense because it was explained thoroughly and completely. I know what I am going to do to study for the exam and I am on track with my team for A12.
 Nothing was really confusing besides trying to get all the reasons why the dam failed.
 I was a bit confused about the exact requirements for units of the instantaneous volumetric flow rate, do we need to make sure it is in multiple units?
 The one thing that was confusing about today's class was how would you go about calculating the efficiency for the power equation?
 Everything was made to be very clear and easy to understand throughout this lecture. The usage of videos and examples to help show engineering failures helped broaden my understanding and helped define engineering failures easier than just giving a standard definition.
 There wasn't anything confusing today. 
 Everything was clear.
 There wasn't anything confusing in this class, I was just confused by the date if the exam which is entirely my fault I came to class prepared to take it today and was relieved when it on Friday 
 Nothing 
 I would have appreciated some more advice on approaching the exam such as extra resources and practice problems.
 Nothing confusing. Good work time today. 
 I believe that everything said in the class period today was clear and had plenty of instructions.
 For the most part, this lecture was very informative and not confusing at all. Maybe a little more information about the format of the exam would be nice.
 Everything was clear, I knew what we had to do and what is due next class. 
 what contribute to engine failure
 I am confused on if we could use calculators or not but it was explained. 
 There was nothing confusing in today's class, it was really well done and explained. 
 What we needed to to in part 6.a
 The amount of time for the in class assignment was not enough time and it was unclear how we were supposed to finish in time.
 I felt this class period was very clear. I did not find myself confused on any part of the class today. 
 Nothing today was confusing! It was a great lecture that was very helpful 
 Everything was clear today. Nothing was confusing
 I still struggle with determining volumetric flow rate. 
 We went over a lot about examples of engineering failures, but most of these mistakes were made by teams, so how do we ensure mistakes dont happen if our team insists on cutting corners?

I found the approach to modeling in A10 very confusing after class. After clearing it up with the professor and doing some experimenting on my own, I cleared it up.
It was confusing how to calculate the volume with given data.
I was not confused today.

The linear regression slides were very confusing to me however after doing the excel activity it is straightforward and i understand the concepts taught
The overall approach to the reservoir's laminar approach was confusing, especially with the example of the graph and trendline. It was a bit vague.
I'm confused as to if we're going to be using the regression equations at all and if we're going to need to remember them, or if this is just to give us background information as to how Excel performs linear regression.
I am still slightly confused on the purpose of finding the overall slope of the data. I know this can help find trends but am confused how this will help with scattered data. Overall, I get the process of it but found the purpose of it confusing.
The reservoir models were a little confusing, but after practicing I was able to figure it out and my team was able to explain it to me.
I found the article explanation regarding the ""Reservoir volume to height relationship"" confusing, and  more specifically on how it was obtained or found. I also found the SSE and SST explanations a bit confusing, as to what they indicate.
Something that was confusing was the individual regression terms such as SSE. I think a more in depth explanation of those terms would help students understand the concepts, even if we have watched the video modules and taken the quizzes.
There wasn’t anything that was confusing or needed more details in today’s class. The information about the regression equation and excel was explained very well and clarified what we learned through the modules.
In general, I learned how to manipulate and produce the trendline and the r^2 in excel, but do we need to know how to actually produce this values manually for engr 131? Or are we just going to learn that in engr 132?
I did not clearly understand how SSE and r^2 are useful in the calculations we need to complete.
What we were supposed to do in the first time slot was confusing because we didn’t know if there was more for us to do because we had so much time.
My team uses excel online for all of us to work on the workbook, you explained very well on creating regression models on excel, but could you explain how to do it on online version. Thank you.

I might need alittle help on the r^2 because it was alittle confusing
I found the equations used for some of the calculations slightly confusing.
Assignment 11 needed more explanation. Specifically, I struggled with the wording of particular questions. If the problems were more descriptive I would have understood the questions much easier.
what i found confusing in todays lecture was what the in class assignment was on. I was confused on what exactly i had to complete. Usually the instructions are posted in chat but they were not this time which was slightly confusing.
I thought that the relationship of the data points based off of the r^2 value was a little confusing in assignment 11.
Nothing was confusing

Simple linear regression needed more details, especially as it relates to what the r squared value does.
One thing that was confusing about today’s class was would you have to show a trend line if the graph is already linear or do you just state that the equation of the line is the best estimate?
I was confused on what to do with the equation and r squared value on the chart.

Prototyping -> 3
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I’m unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions. -> 5
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. -> 2
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea -> 4
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. -> 3
Nothing was confusing in today’s class -> 1
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype -> 2
Something that could use more details in today’s class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn’t catch all the dates. -> 1
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. -> 4
I thought the most difficult aspect of today’s class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them. -> 2
How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don’t remember going over it in the video modules and it isn’t explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams’ understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. -> 3
The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them. -> 4
Everything made sense into today’s class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense. -> 2
I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used -> 3
What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don’t have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted) -> 4
The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions. -> 2
A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren’t easily accessible. -> 2
I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well. -> 2
I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. -> 3
It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren’t really something we can just go out and test. -> 3
How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials. -> 2
I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be. -> 2
Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear -> 1
I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week. -> 3
I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process. -> 4
I wasn’t confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong. -> 1
I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow. -> 4
How we should go about testing any physical model that we create -> 4
I would’ve appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful. -> 3
I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes. -> 3
Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible. -> 3
One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test? -> 3
I found it confusing how we are going to create a prototype for some of our designs -> 4
I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don’t always have the resources -> 2

We only had one confusing point during the lecture, we didn’t understand if it was supposed to be 3 different designs or 3 different ideas prototyped. This was solved however in our breakout room -> 2

 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don’t have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.
 A confusing thing was the building of prototypes. It was confusing because of the use of materials that aren’t easily accessible. 
 I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
 I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making. 
 It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren’t really something we can just go out and test.
 How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
 I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.
 Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear 
 I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week. 
 I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process. 
 I wasn’t confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
 I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
 How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
 I would’ve appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.
 I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes. 
 Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.
 One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test?
 I found it confusing how we are going to create a prototype for some of our designs
 I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don’t always have the resources
 What options we would have for making prototypes. If there were things we are not allowed to do on campus that would limit what we can do. 
 How in depth the experiments should be
 I was confused as to how to actually test a prototype. 
 Nothing today 
 nothing was confusing
 The research method and way of testing was confusing. Nothing was clarified.
 More details about the testing procedure section would be helpful 
 Thinking of prototypes while most of our ideas had to do with the road was confusing
 Nothing was confusing today. There was nothing to be confusing though because everything explained had to do with methods of prototyping.
 We only had one confusing point during the lecture, we didn’t understand if it was supposed to be 3 different designs or 3 different ideas prototyped. This was solved however in our breakout room 
 Nothing was confusing today! Professor Menekse explained the prototyping process well, which helped us to discuss ways to make prototype our designs
 Everything was clear and easy to understand
 How we should make a prototype that we can also test, for example cad models would be hard to test for a18.

I think prototyping in general is a bit confusing, at least to me. I dont really know how should I approach prototype making.
It was a little confusing how we are supposed to test our prototypes without actually having physical prototypes. My group is doing CAD models, and are having difficulty determining how we are going to effectively test our models, as they aren't really something we can just go out and test.
How we can test our ideas was confusing because our ideas must be used on such a large sclae and we have such limited materials.
I did not completely understand how through our prototypes had to be.
Nothing was confusing or hard to understand. Everything was very clear
I haven't been exposed to a lot of the prototyping methods like CAD, so I feel like it might be pretty tough to learn something like that in the next week.
I thought it was confusing when we talked about the surveys because I was unsure if they counted as part of the prototype testing process.
I wasn't confused about anything today. We just had a few hiccups with our last grade and discussed with the TA what we got wrong.
I thought that the discussion of the importance of prototyping was interesting. It had good information and was easy to follow.
How we should go about testing any physical model that we create
I would've appreciated if we went over some examples of what a strong experiment looks like versus a weak one. Additionally, how we could measure if our experiments were successful.
I am confused on how to exactly test my virtual prototypes.
Knowing how to prototype virtually can be difficult and confusing at times, and having useful accessible materials is not always possible.
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how are we supposed to test our design on a virtual platform if the platform only allows you to design not test? Or do you have to make the physical prototype and then test?
I found it confusing how we are going to create a prototype for some of our designs
I was a bit confused still on how detailed we needed to make our prototypes especially since we don't always have the resources
What options we would have for making prototypes. If there were things we are not allowed to do on campus that would limit what we can do.
How in depth the experiments should be
I was confused as to how to actually test a prototype.
Nothing today
nothing was confusing
The research method and way of testing was confusing. Nothing was clarified.
More details about the testing procedure section would be helpful
Thinking of prototypes while most of our ideas had to do with the road was confusing
Nothing was confusing today. There was nothing to be confusing though because everything explained had to do with methods of prototyping.
We only had one confusing point during the lecture, we didn't understand if it was supposed to be 3 different designs or 3 different ideas prototyped. This was solved however in our breakout room
Nothing was confusing today! Professor Menekse explained the prototyping process well, which helped us to discuss ways to make prototype our designs
Everything was clear and easy to understand
How we should make a prototype that we can also test, for example cad models would be hard to test for a18.
Nothing
the specifications of assignment 18 needed a bit more clarification, but otherwise all was pretty clear
I was confused by the way we can implement questions for the concrete details","Today's class was little confusing and I didn't need any extra details.
Prototyping 
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes. 
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea 
I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
Nothing was confusing in today's class
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype 
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates. 
We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them.
 How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
 Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
 I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
 What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
 The details for the assignment was confusing to me. The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment. I think after the slides are posted we will be able to review it and answer our questions.

the assignment number 5 -> 3
I felt all the details were clear during this class -> 1
One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. -> 1
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for? -> 2
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel. -> 3
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant. -> 1
Bike share group project. -> 2
The z score was roughly explained -> 3
How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? -> 5
I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost. -> 3
What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn’t know what to do. -> 3
Nothing was confusing today during class -> 1
I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data. -> 3
I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from -> 4
The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better -> 2
The explanation for what to do for assignment 08 -> 3
How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. -> 2
I wasn’t really confused today -> 1
Assignment 5 because we did not go over it. -> 2
The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn’t seem to have much discription. -> 2
I find probability in general confusing. -> 4
I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. -> 3
The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. -> 3
I would’ve appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point. -> 2
Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve. -> 4
Nothing, class was great as usual -> 1
Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation. -> 3
I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. -> 2
Today’s class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation -> 1
Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5? -> 1
I am not sure about exactly what z value does -> 2
Everything went well in today’s class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn’t know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it. -> 1
There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. -> 2
I thought that we could’ve spent a little more time on probability, since it’s what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps. -> 1
Nothing really -> 1
The main confusing part about today’s class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project. -> 3
The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before. -> 3
I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. -> 3
I’m still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. -> 1
Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. -> 1
Nothing was confusing for me -> 1
submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice -> 3
I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I’m still not sure what it determines. -> 4
I didn’t find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for awhile. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd -> 2
Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6. -> 3
nothing, everything was clear today -> 1
Data types -> 2
One topic that required more details from today’s class was how probability from a histogram can be applied. -> 3
The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. -> 3
How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. -> 4
The description of assignment 8 was confusing -> 4
Nothing was confusing to me today. -> 1
Nothing was very confusing about today’s class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. -> 4
Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration. -> 3
The way to calculate the curve with integrals. -> 3
Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral) -> 4
I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?) -> 3
I thought the explanations of the skittles stuff could be explained a bit more. It was a bit unclear but not too bad. -> 1
The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better. -> 4
What we had to do in class -> 3
It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it. -> 1
The assignments some times are very confusing. We don’t even go through them and the PDFs don’t say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear. -> 3
Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later. -> 2
How to organize my data -> 2
It’s confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05 -> 4
I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab. -> 2
N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework! -> 1
What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity -> 2
I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came -> 5
Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don’t know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using -> 2
I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation -> 1
Nothing, today was pretty straightforward -> -
The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it’s a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use -> 3
How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? -> 1
I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more. -> 3
Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. -> 3","Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would’ve liked a bit more information about it, and how it works. -> 4

I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data.
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data?
I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
Nothing was confusing today during class
I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better
The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score.
I wasn't really confused today
Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
I find probability in general confusing.
I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles.
The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it.
I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
Nothing, class was great as usual
Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data.
Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
I am not sure about exactly what z value does
Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team.
I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
Nothing really
The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides.
I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail.
Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate.
Nothing was confusing for me
submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines.
I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
nothing, everything was clear today
Data types
One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing.
How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining.
The description of assignment 8 was confusing
Nothing was confusing to me today.
Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly.
Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
I thought the explanations of the skittles stuff could be explained a bit more. It was a bit unclear but not too bad.
The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
What we had to do in class
It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
How to organize my data
It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using
I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
Nothing, today was pretty straightforward
The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage?
I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages.","Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.

Maybe some more specifics into the uses of excel for assignment 3 or general engineering, but in general the lecture was quite robust and the slides were very informative.
Occasionally, especially at the end, the presentation moved too quickly and became confusing.  I found myself having to re read large portions of it afterwards because it was too fast paced and difficult to follow.
I though everything was described well in class and do not need further details.","In this lecture, students were confused by the different charts and would require further clarification. Students were also confused by the typing of certain symbols and formulas into Excel. Students also require further instruction on the specifics into the uses of excel for assignment 3. Students also had questions regarding numerical or categorical data and how to classify them.","Everything was pretty clear. But, I would like to review more on the different types of charts. One thing that was a little confusing was the typing of certain symbols and formulas into Excel. For example, it was difficult for me to remember how to lock certain numbers as absolute values. Once I refreshed my memory I was able to get it because I did have experience with it while watching the pre-class videos, but it was a lot for me to remember. Also, I never figured out how to type the symbol for degrees with my keyboard into Excel. It was not a big deal, but I am guessing that learning that information will save me some time and energy in the future. I was slightly confused about why the example problem in class today was a scatter plot, not a line graph. However, after speaking with my peers, the confusion was cleared up. Some of the questions regarding numerical or categorical were sort of confusing; for example, if zip codes are categorical or numerical data. I searched it up online and understood it a bit more, but it would be nice if you could explain it in class.

writing equations on matlab -> 3
I learned some new commands in MATLAB like which ones were used NY the system like the ""if"" command and that they came be overwritten. I also got practice at doing math in MATLAB & remembered to use periods when doing matrices when using scalars as exponents for them. I like that we can work ahead if we can because it allowed me to finish assignment 2 & 3 while getting almost all of 4 done. -> 4
It was learning the different functions and commands and getting to test them. The practice assignment was also important and interesting. In particular, the commands with e and log functions was interesting. -> 3
I found the built in functions in mat lab pretty interesting and that we can just call most mathematical functions in the script. -> 5
That multiple commands can lead to the same conclusion. -> 3
I found it interesting that we are able to type a function into our code and it immediately gives us a unique problem that we would have to solve. -> 5
Learning what the basics of MatLab were so that we can get a better understanding of how to use MatLab for the duration if the semester. -> 4
I was able to learn more about how to use MATLAB today. I utilized some functions to solve problems that was assigned using the new functions that I learned today. -> 4
The various commands in matlab were interesting. I especially liked how Professor Wible showed different ways to get the same result in matlab. -> 3
I found that the methods for writing equations in matlab was pretty interesting. I also think the clc and clear commands were very useful. -> 2
I liked exploring the program and finding how to best use variables and function to solve the problems. -> 3
I found the built-in functions to be the most interesting in todays class because they were slightly different from what I expected them to be, however they function in a very useful manner for calculations. -> 4

Todays class was about complex loops. It was really hard for me to see the point in them. We basically eliminate loops that are designed to make our jobs easier such as for loops and while loops, and use other methods to get the same answer.  -> 3
I was confused when I was getting the wrong answer for number one on a11 -> 2
I found the nested loops a bit confusing.  -> 2
how to do question 1, no hints were really given -> 2
The operations performed in the for and while loop examples on the board were a bit confusing because the computation kept getting messed up, but it was okay.  -> 3
I was confused on how to do the ica since it had no instructions -> 3

One thing that I was confused on was part 1 of A11 where I needed to do the complete opposite for the else statement, but I was helped out and I fixed it. -> 3
I was confused by A11 problem 1 because I did not have much experience converting loop structure to vector operations. -> 3
Today I thought that the removing loops concept was confusing. It made sense in the examples that are given and the in class activity, but the part of A11 that covered it was way more complex. -> 4
Nothing was confusing. I found the description of complex loops to be great and the slides/in class activity helped a lot. -> 1

While the nested loops were covered extensively, I still found myself being at question of what formatting is allowed for these types of loops. -> 3

 Transforming the data through matlab was super interesting. It was nice using logs again 
 I like converting different graphs and trying to find the real shape and pattern of it
 Being able to linearize different types of data. Makes everything easier to graph.
 Non linear regression
 I like this data modeling part of the class.
 Linear modeling non-linear regression. Also thank you for moving the last quiz! 
 It was great to see how excel and matlab mix together.
 I found it interesting how we can alter the axis to make the data appear linear.
 Practicing applying the different forms of graphs both in excel and matlab.
 Like doing regression! 
 Excel functions being translated to matlab
 being able to do everything easily on excel and MATLAB
 Finding the best type of equation to model data 
 I found linearizing the datain different ways interesting 
 using excel

 I found the different types of nonlinear modeling to be interesting. I figured there must be some way to model data that is not in a straight line, but I never realized that it is done by scaling the axes to make the data appear linear.

The explanation of your plastic sheet and lightbulb experiment was really neat and caught my interests. -> 4
I thought having the visual examples was interesting because it makes topics easier to understand. -> 4
I found it interesting how similar electric force is to gravitational force. -> 3
I found the demonstration done to show the lightbulb lighting was very interesting because of the separation of charges. -> 4
The group work in solving the distribution of charge -> 1
What I found most interesting today was that there can be two components of an electrostatic force. I found this interesting because  I’m working with forces that are invisible. -> 4
Energy conservation in particle physics with a gamma ray photon being split into an electron and positron was very intriguing since I’ve never learned much about gamma rays in the past. -> 5
The amount of interaction we were able to have with you as an instructor and in breakout rooms was interesting. -> 3
I thought the demonstration with the lightbulb was fun to watch. It gave me a visual representation of what was happening. -> 3
I found interesting how similar the forces caused by charges and gravity are. -> 4
I like that the math is pretty consistent and the laws and theorems are pretty easily definable I just get messed up when you’re doing demonstrations that move really quickly and the words go over my head. -> 4
I found the clicker question about F and F’ very interesting. -> 3
The shell theory was a very interesting concept and easy to understand because it is so similar to how you treat round objects in translational motion which helped me understand it better -> 4
i really like learning about the electric charges and i like learning about electrons after taking so many chemistry classes -> 3
The final question about charges on the corners of a square. -> 3
The demonstration in the beginning was interesting. I like it better when I can see what is happening. -> 2
I found that the different ways charges spread out was interesting and I understood the differences between all of the examples of them -> 4
I enjoyed doing the practice problems because I believe that is the best way to learn. -> 4

I like the derivation process because you can get answers for any shape.
Today’s lecture was very interesting. It showed how Gaussian symmetry in different shapes were similar.
I found it interesting that when we use symmetry for an infinite plane, the electric field is a constant.
I think it’s interesting how the shell theorem can be used in physics
I thought this concept was easy to grasp. The videos did a great job of helping me picture the scenarios.","i thought the top hat questions were interesting because they spiked my thinking.
I found it neat and helpful that drawing a Gaussian surface around or through certain objects with uniform surface charge makes finding E on the object much easier. However knowing how to orient the Gaussian surface seems a bit difficult in some situations.
The fact that we can model something as complex as flux through symmetrical objects without needing to carry out complex integrals 
On the same note, I find the concept and idea of Gauss’ law interesting in that there are shapes you can use to make the math easier to solve

133,23,23,Alex,phys0174-fall2020,4,Describe what you found most interesting in today’s class,"Velocity of a moving object can vary depending on viewpoint, but acceleration will be the same. -> 5
I enjoyed rearranging the equations to fit the information available. It was good problem solving and felt like figuring out a puzzle. -> 4
What was the most interesting was physically solving the kinematic problems. It’s like a puzzle to me. -> 5
I found the conceptual questions that go along with free fall interesting. I like the concept of gravity being constant acceleration. -> 3
The most interesting part was learning about free fall and comparing the graphs -> 3
Break out rooms were fun and enjoyable -> 4
The most interesting thing in today’s lecture was how the position, velocity, and acceleration graphs relate to each other. -> 4
I like projectile motion from my high school physics class so when this video lecture began to talk about gravity and free fall, I really enjoyed it. -> 4
I thought memorizing the 5 kinematic equations was important. -> 1
I found the example problem about earth’s gravity to be the most interesting because of the obvious real-world application. -> 3
How you are able to derive different equations to fit the situation you need. -> 3
Analyzing the different approaches/ways to get the same solution -> 4
Today I thought the dinosaur problem was most interesting and see at what location they meet when each moving dinosaur has two different accelerations. -> 3
I enjoy it being interactive. I found the idea of using systems of equations for some kinematics interesting. It all connects in some way. -> 4
the problem with dinosaurs and how to solve by combining accelerations was new and helpful -> 4
The dinosaurs (Jurassic park vibes), and the intro to group was interesting, because it gave me an idea of how things will work in the future for quizzes and tophat questions. -> 3
I found the conceptual questions interesting because some of them seemed tricky. -> 3
I liked working in the breakout room to solve the dinosaur problem, and how you can substitute the variables to solve -> 4
The dinosaur problem was most interesting. I enjoyed that it really challenged you to think about how to set the equations equal to each other and which equation to pick. -> 4
I loved how vectors were translated into real life examples and how we were able to calculate values to determine placement and speed. -> 3
I enjoyed the conceptual top hat questions during this lecture. These connections brought a true understanding of how kinematics work in real life (neglecting air resistance of course). -> 3
gravity based problems -> 3
problems including two objects colliding, using both objects’ acceleration -> 2
I like the problems involving the five kinematic equations. -> 4
I found that the review of the conceptual information was very helpful -> 1
I really enjoyed going over free fall in class. Because it’s graph is parabolic, the velocity at its highest point is 0, and the time it takes to for an object to go up equals the time for an object to go down, which I thought was interesting. -> 3
How accelerations can combine in relative motion. -> 3
The top hat questions were interesting, especially the ones that involved when velocity vs acceleration are zero. -> 3
The one thing that I found interesting about today’s lecture was the different ways coordinate systems can be drawn. I thought there were a set amount of options for how a space should be considered, but you gave some new examples that dispelled that belief. -> 3
You could use 12-x as a substitute for delta c during the dinosaur practice problem -> 4
The problems were engaging -> 3
The velocity can be constant even if it is accelerating -> 4
Deriving the 5 kinematic equations and seeing how each could be manipulated into the rest. -> 4
The Dino problem was interesting cause I was able to learn a new way to solve a kinematics problem. -> 3
i found it interesting that you can use different kinematics equations and methods to solve the same problem -> 4
The hot air balloon problem was kind of fun, and so was the faucet one since they both had that extra twist (initial upward velocity and drop rate), though it easily could have edged into frustrating. -> 3
The dinosaur problem and figuring out how to use the kinematics equations to solve the problem -> 3
I liked the discussion of the directionality that the dinosaurs ran in (how the negatives cancelled on one and the equation ended up positive) -> 3
Circular motion, how acceleration and velocity are different in a circle -> 2
I liked trying to solve the dinosaur problem because we had to use substitution to find the time. -> 4
top hat questions -> 3
An object thrown in the air is always accelerating -> 2
understanding and getting the majority of the problems asked in tophat correct. this means that i have some sort of a grasp and understand of the topic we’re on. -> 3
Putting the kinematics equations to use with real world problems was most interesting because I like the application process of equations. -> 4
I thought that taking the derivative of position to get velocity was very interesting. -> 4
Being able to find the time of collision with two different objects with different accelerations. -> 2
I found the breakout rooms to be the most interesting. Working as a team is always more productive as I was able to hear different approaches to solving the problem. -> 3
The most interesting part of the lecture for me would be the free fall equations, because of how using the graphs make the problems easier to comprehend. -> 3
The application of derivatives to graphing functions and calculating components of vectors -> 2
The most interesting topic was free fall motion. -> 1
I liked the demonstration of using the 5 variables to make 5 equations, each lacking one of the variables. In my previous physics course, I had only been given the equations. They weren’t equally explained. -> 3
The way you can rearrange and substitute the kinematics equations to solve for any of the variables as long as you are given three. -> 5

top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class -> 3
I find it interesting that if you were to shoot a bullet straight up, out of a car that was traveling at a constant speed, the bullet would eventually come back and hit the car. -> 5
I though the most interesting part was how when 2 ojects are mid air travel, gravity cancels out since they are both experienceing it the same, regardless of the x value -> 5
I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I've always had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made a lot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophat relative velocity question correct. -> 2
I thought projectile motion was interesting because I learned that vertical and horizontal motions are independent. Although the x component’s velocity is constant, the y component’s velocity is not. -> 3
the monkey experiment that was shown -> 3
I think the most interesting thing was the various projectile practice problems because they were fun to do, and since I'd already covered kinematics earlier, doing new things was fun. -> 2
I love the conceptual and find it very easy to understand them, such as the truck and pitching machine. I think visuals really help! -> 5
I appreciated the video demonstrating the monkey because it helped me to visualize the equation. -> 3
I actually understood how to do projectile problems! -> 5
Free fall problems, in particular the monkey problem because of its uniqueness -> 3
I loved group work and solving problems in pairs -> 4
The physics behind the monkey and bullet example, where aiming for the monkey before falling will make the bullet hit it. -> 5
The monkey experiment is interesting. -> 4
The explanation of the truck and baseball pitching machine question. -> 5
The monkey video was the most interesting thing in today’s lecture because it was different and fun. -> 2
The example of the monkey that was falling while there was a gun that shot it. The idea that no matter where you aim as long as you aim at the monkey you will hit it. -> 4
Definitely the monkey hunting problem. Although I was  confused by the solution, i was really intrigued by the scenario. It was fascinating that the monkey fell right as the golf ball was released, and it made impact right before the monkey hit the ground. -> 5
The concept of how separate the x and y components are in projectile motion. -> 4

I love the conceptual and find it very easy to understand them, such as the truck and pitching machine. I think visuals really help!
I appreciated the video demonstrating the monkey because it helped me to visualize the equation.
I actually understood how to do projectile problems!
Free fall problems, in particular the monkey problem because of its uniqueness
I loved group work and solving problems in pairs
The physics behind the monkey and bullet example, where aiming for the monkey before falling will make the bullet hit it.
The monkey experiment is interesting.
The explanation of the truck and baseball pitching machine question.
The monkey video was the most interesting thing in today’s lecture because it was different and fun.
The example of the monkey that was falling while there was a gun that shot it. The idea that no matter where you aim as long as you aim at the monkey you will hit it.
Definitely the monkey hunting problem. Although I was  confused by the solution, i was really intrigued by the scenario. It was fascinating that the monkey fell right as the golf ball was released, and it made impact right before the monkey hit the ground.
The concept of how separate the x and y components are in projectile motion.
I liked the breakout rooms. It was interesting to hear the points of other students.
I was interested to learn about projectile motion again since learning the same thing in high school.
I found the monkey shooting video to be most interesting.
I found the example about the gun and the monkey most interesting. It was interesting how if you aimed the gun at the monkey and the monkey dropped you would always hit the monkey
The monkey problem still kinda blows my mind even after hearing it almost 5 times. One of the reasons why I think physics is pretty cool.
I found projectile motion very interesting as it can have plenty of real life applications.
I like the video. that really helped me visualize the problem
I found it most interesting that if you aim the bullet/banana at the monkey, it will still hit the monkey when it drops at the same time.
I found the monkey and the hunter problem interesting. I loved the connection when finding out that to hit the monkey, you aim for the monkey.
Calculating 2-D motion
I think the most interesting and important part was learning the horizontal and vertical velocity act completely independent of each other
The group questions
The monkey question was pretty interesting. Especially watching the video gave a clear depiction of what the question was asking and it was also entertaining to watch.
I thought it was very interesting comparing the relative motion to vectors
The relative motion examples were very interesting, the change in perspective was informative.
The monkey being shot with the ball while falling out of the air.
understanding the vector subtraction on the quiz
Monkey problem.
falling monkey
I found the video interesting along with getting to go into our breakout rooms to work through the problems.
Two objects will land in the same place during projectile motion if they have the same x velocity
The underlying concept of relative motion as a whole
The example with the hunter and the money was very interesting and quite fascinating.
I found it interesting that in projectile motion the horizontal and vertical direction are completely independent.
I thought that relative motion was the most interesting, since it gives you multiple perspectives.
projectile motion specifically how in the x direction, velocity is constant
The idea that horizontal and vertical motions are independent.
The monkey and hunter video! It's great to see live demos
I found the fact that a free fall object and a projectile will come in contact with each other.
projectile motion and falling monkey
I really enjoyed the bullet tophat question. It was a fun topic to think about.
The physical representation of projectile motions seen through the x and y components of a velocity time graph.
The kinematic equation were you use both directions to solve for unknowns. I enjoy doing these
The FBD drawings
I think the top hat questions kept me engaged and they were also pretty intresting!
How you have to separate the x and y components to solve
Definitely projectile motion because it was interesting to see how the different properties changed the displacement of the object.
There’s no acceleration in the x direction of projectile motion.","I liked the top hat questions. I feel they are engaging and make it easier to learn material.
I found the monkey problem interesting because it proves a real world situation with our understanding of projectile motion
top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I find it interesting that if you were to shoot a bullet straight up, out of a car that was traveling at a constant speed, the bullet would eventually come back and hit the car.
I though the most interesting part was how when 2 ojects are mid air travel, gravity cancels out since they are both experienceing it the same, regardless of the x value
I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I've always had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made a lot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophat relative velocity question correct.
I thought projectile motion was interesting because I learned that vertical and horizontal motions are independent. Although the x component’s velocity is constant, the y component’s velocity is not.

I actually understood how to do projectile problems!
Free fall problems, in particular the monkey problem because of its uniqueness
I loved group work and solving problems in pairs
The physics behind the monkey and bullet example, where aiming for the monkey before falling will make the bullet hit it.
The monkey experiment is interesting.
The explanation of the truck and baseball pitching machine question.
The monkey video was the most interesting thing in today's lecture because it was different and fun.
The example of the monkey that was falling while there was a gun that shot it. The idea that no matter where you aim as long as you aim at the monkey you will hit it.
Definitely the monkey hunting problem. Although I was  confused by the solution, i was really intrigued by the scenario. It was fascinating that the monkey fell right as the golf ball was released, and it made impact right before the monkey hit the ground.
The concept of how separate the x and y components are in projectile motion.
I liked the breakout rooms. It was interesting to hear the points of other students.
I was interested to learn about projectile motion again since learning the same thing in high school.
I found the monkey shooting video to be most interesting.
I found the example about the gun and the monkey most interesting. It was interesting how if you aimed the gun at the monkey and the monkey dropped you would always hit the monkey
The monkey problem still kinda blows my mind even after hearing it almost 5 times. One of the reasons why I think physics is pretty cool.
I found projectile motion very interesting as it can have plenty of real life applications.
I like the video. that really helped me visualize the problem
I found it most interesting that if you aim the bullet/banana at the monkey, it will still hit the monkey when it drops at the same time.
I found the monkey and the hunter problem interesting. I loved the connection when finding out that to hit the monkey, you aim for the monkey.
Calculating 2-D motion
I think the most interesting and important part was learning the horizontal and vertical velocity act completely independent of each other
The group questions
The monkey question was pretty interesting. Especially watching the video gave a clear depiction of what the question was asking and it was also entertaining to watch.
I thought it was very interesting comparing the relative motion to vectors
The relative motion examples were very interesting, the change in perspective was informative.
The monkey being shot with the ball while falling out of the air.
understanding the vector subtraction on the quiz
Monkey problem.
falling monkey
I found the video interesting along with getting to go into our breakout rooms to work through the problems.
Two objects will land in the same place during projectile motion if they have the same x velocity
The underlying concept of relative motion as a whole
The example with the hunter and the money was very interesting and quite fascinating.
I found it interesting that in projectile motion the horizontal and vertical direction are completely independent.
I thought that relative motion was the most interesting, since it gives you multiple perspectives.
projectile motion specifically how in the x direction, velocity is constant
The idea that horizontal and vertical motions are independent.
The monkey and hunter video! It's great to see live demos
I found the fact that a free fall object and a projectile will come in contact with each other.
projectile motion and falling monkey
I really enjoyed the bullet tophat question. It was a fun topic to think about.
The physical representation of projectile motions seen through the x and y components of a velocity time graph.
The kinematic equation were you use both directions to solve for unknowns. I enjoy doing these
The FBD drawings
I think the top hat questions kept me engaged and they were also pretty intresting!
How you have to separate the x and y components to solve
Definitely projectile motion because it was interesting to see how the different properties changed the displacement of the object.
There's no acceleration in the x direction of projectile motion.","I liked the top hat questions. I feel they are engaging and make it easier to learn material.
I found the monkey problem interesting because it proves a real world situation with our understanding of projectile motion
top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I find it interesting that if you were to shoot a bullet straight up, out of a car that was traveling at a constant speed, the bullet would eventually come back and hit the car.
I though the most interesting part was how when 2 ojects are mid air travel, gravity cancels out since they are both experienceing it the same, regardless of the x value
I found that the relative velocity problems pretty interesting. I've always had a bit of trouble understanding the problems, but it made a lot more sense once it was explained and ibwas able to get the tophat relative velocity question correct.
I thought projectile motion was interesting because I learned that vertical and horizontal motions are independent. Although the x component's velocity is constant, the y component's velocity is not.
the monkey experiment that was shown 
I think the most interesting thing was the various projectile practice problems because they were fun to do, and since I'd already covered kinematics earlier, doing new things was fun.

The first top hat problem with the 3 blocks and the problem with the sled being pushed and pulled. I was quite fascinated with the answers for both of these.
I enjoyed the amount of conceptual top hat questions during the lecture. Conceptual questions are always great practice to test understanding and prepare for the conceptual part of the exam.
I found the practice problems on top hat to be most interesting about today’s lecture
The coefficient of friction, either static or kinetic, is usually smaller than 1.
I found learning about how friction was really interesting. It was cool to understand how the cold welds between two surfaces impacted friction.
Working in breakout rooms was enjoyable
I found it interesting that surface area does not affect the force it takes for a mass to slide off a surface.
Looking at the different coefficients of friction and seeing how they can change the situation easily
I love friction problems, as they are simply force diagram problems. Seeing how different objects have different coefficients and why is super cool
The question combined what we learned this week and last week.
I found interesting how lifting up on something can ease the friction force and allow an object to be moved with less required force because of that.
Surface area doesn’t affect friction, only normal force and the friction coefficient matter
How the formulas were explained for friction and how there are different types.
Dr. Nero demonstrate how to solve friction problems with 2 body diagrams set up
It was interesting to see force applied to real life using friction.
The different uses of applying the free body diagrams in various problems
I thought the example with the sandpaper was interesting because we got to “see” what we’ve been learning. Also, going into breakout rooms was interesting.
I liked the pirate question it threw me for a loop at force because I didn’t understand why normal force wasn’t just equal to mg but made sense after I talked with me group mates.
I found the description of static friction most interesting. I think static friction is more interesting than kinetic friction because when static friction reaches it’s maximum value, any amount of force applied will accelerate the object.
i was able to understand and get the majority of the top hat questions correct. i felt that the lecture videos really helped
Break out room discussions
I enjoy top hat questions because they help put the content into an interactive learning style.
the concept of static friction changing with the force against it
I enjoyed applying the coefficients of friction to a box on a slope.
I really enjoyed the conceptual TopHat questions. I feel like they help me in application problems later in lecture and in the homework.
i found the exapmle of solving for friction of the sand paper block interesting
Free body diagrams of systems
How pulling is more efficient than pushing
The problem about pushing or pulling a sled, in particular how the angle you push an object changes the force you need to move it
What I found most interesting in today’s lecture was the conceptual questions. The sled question tricked me a little so it was interesting to see what the answer was and why.
Use of multiple free body diagrams in one problem
That it is easier to prevent an object from moving than to slow it down with friction
I thought that learning that surface area didn’t really contribute to the force of friction was interesting
I like the question with the two blocks where one was pushed on top of the other.
I found the his explanation with the force of friction interesting
I thought the fact that more SA being on a surface not creating for static friction was interesting
I found the fact that you can find the coefficient of friction by simply knowing theta.
i was interested by the idea that pulling is easier than pushing and the math behind it
Top hat question
I found the group questions most interesting since they required both calculation and some conceptual knowledge on our part.
I found it interesting how surface area is not included in the friction equation.
Using two equations to find the static of friction coefficient was similar to tension problems
The sandpaper block on the sandpaper ramp
Is coefficient of friction dependent on anything besides materials?
I enjoyed how I could easily visualize what I learned using my experience from everyday life.

The most interesting thing I’d how friction was explained. Such as cold weld and hot weld.
The noise produced when you push something across a surface is due to cold welds
I thought learning about the coefficient of friction and how it’s proportional to the normal force was interesting.
I found cold welds interesting because I hadn’t heard about them (memorably) before
The explanation of coefficient of friction was pretty interesting.
The cold welding and atomic interactions causing friction were cool
Friction relation to the normal force was cool","I thought it was interesting that friction is a property that goes down to the subatomic level. 
While the most confusing, I found the question about the two blocks hanging from the pulley the most interesting. I also liked the top hat questions because they weren’t too hard but not too easy as well. 
the information about cold vs. hot welds.
Being able to solve forces with very little information because variables will cancel out as you go through 
I enjoy the friction problems and the fun examples used inside of class.

The different uses of applying the free body diagrams in various problems
I thought the example with the sandpaper was interesting because we got to “see” what we've been learning. Also, going into breakout rooms was interesting.
I liked the pirate question it threw me for a loop at force because I didn't understand why normal force wasn't just equal to mg but made sense after I talked with me group mates.
I found the description of static friction most interesting. I think static friction is more interesting than kinetic friction because when static friction reaches it's maximum value, any amount of force applied will accelerate the object.
i was able to understand and get the majority of the top hat questions correct. i felt that the lecture videos really helped
Break out room discussions
I enjoy top hat questions because they help put the content into an interactive learning style.
the concept of static friction changing with the force against it
I enjoyed applying the coefficients of friction to a box on a slope.
I really enjoyed the conceptual TopHat questions. I feel like they help me in application problems later in lecture and in the homework.
i found the exapmle of solving for friction of the sand paper block interesting
Free body diagrams of systems
How pulling is more efficient than pushing
The problem about pushing or pulling a sled, in particular how the angle you push an object changes the force you need to move it
What I found most interesting in today's lecture was the conceptual questions. The sled question tricked me a little so it was interesting to see what the answer was and why.
Use of multiple free body diagrams in one problem
That it is easier to prevent an object from moving than to slow it down with friction
I thought that learning that surface area didn't really contribute to the force of friction was interesting
I like the question with the two blocks where one was pushed on top of the other.
I found the his explanation with the force of friction interesting
I thought the fact that more SA being on a surface not creating for static friction was interesting
I found the fact that you can find the coefficient of friction by simply knowing theta.
i was interested by the idea that pulling is easier than pushing and the math behind it
Top hat question
I found the group questions most interesting since they required both calculation and some conceptual knowledge on our part.
I found it interesting how surface area is not included in the friction equation.
Using two equations to find the static of friction coefficient was similar to tension problems
The sandpaper block on the sandpaper ramp
Is coefficient of friction dependent on anything besides materials?
I enjoyed how I could easily visualize what I learned using my experience from everyday life.
the cold welds, Fn on the atomic level
The most interesting thing I'd how friction was explained. Such as cold weld and hot weld.
The noise produced when you push something across a surface is due to cold welds
I thought learning about the coefficient of friction and how it's proportional to the normal force was interesting.
I found cold welds interesting because I hadn't heard about them (memorably) before
The explanation of coefficient of friction was pretty interesting.
The cold welding and atomic interactions causing friction were cool
Friction relation to the normal force was cool","I thought it was interesting that friction is a property that goes down to the subatomic level. 
While the most confusing, I found the question about the two blocks hanging from the pulley the most interesting. I also liked the top hat questions because they weren't too hard but not too easy as well. 
the information about cold vs. hot welds.
Being able to solve forces with very little information because variables will cancel out as you go through 
I enjoy the friction problems and the fun examples used inside of class.
Surprised by the answer to the second question, I thought the lower block was just put in to confuse us
Calculating the coefficient of friction for sandpaper 
I found that learning how to set up the system and what masses are included is important to solving friction problems
Learning about the relationship between normal force and friction and how friction works and looks molecularly.
mu > 1
 The first top hat problem with the 3 blocks and the problem with the sled being pushed and pulled. I was quite fascinated with the answers for both of these.
 I enjoyed the amount of conceptual top hat questions during the lecture. Conceptual questions are always great practice to test understanding and prepare for the conceptual part of the exam.
 I found the practice problems on top hat to be most interesting about today's lecture
 The coefficient of friction, either static or kinetic, is usually smaller than 1.
 I found learning about how friction was really interesting. It was cool to understand how the cold welds between two surfaces impacted friction.
 Working in breakout rooms was enjoyable
 I found it interesting that surface area does not affect the force it takes for a mass to slide off a surface.
 Looking at the different coefficients of friction and seeing how they can change the situation easily
 I love friction problems, as they are simply force diagram problems. Seeing how different objects have different coefficients and why is super cool
 The question combined what we learned this week and last week.
 I found interesting how lifting up on something can ease the friction force and allow an object to be moved with less required force because of that. 
 Surface area doesn't affect friction, only normal force and the friction coefficient matter
 How the formulas were explained for friction and how there are different types.

 The confusing part about today’s lecture was the third top hat question. I was confused as to why it was negative. Then it was explained that the c vector went backwards, which made the whole value negative.
 The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the end of class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. We only talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I’m sure with more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lot better.
 I think how to calculate the angles (right hand rule) and the negative vs positive vector could be a explained a little bit more? The videos were super helpful of course but it’d be nice to know for sure that I understand it correctly :)
 The thing that I found confusing in today’s lecture was the problem involving a dot product. I wasn’t aware that the angle between the two vectors was where the tails were end to end.
 Cross products are confusing when determining the directions of the vectors but practice problems can really help. 
 I thought today’s lecture was great! I enjoyed having tricky vector problems with the tails not matching. I am confused by the going backwards from acceleration to velocity and would like more examples of that. 
 The cross product was a little confusing because I didn’t know where to apply it in terms of physics.
 direction of result when using cross product
 Using the right hand rule
 Some of the tophat questions lacked directions and made them hard to understand. 
 I am still confused about how to visualize the right hand rule on a 2D graph. When would it be considered left-handed?
 I need more details on how to graphically change from displacement to velocity and acceleration.
 The position, velocity and acceleration graphs were very confusing. Also, I understood the dot and cross methods when doing the lecture videos and homework problems, but when working in breakout groups today, everyone in my group was going about the problem a different way which confused me. 
 I didn’t quite understand the explanation of why the acceleration was positive when the car went up and back down the ramp since it had to stop to change direction.","Some students are still having some issues with dot and cross products, as well as the right-hand rule.

I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes. However, your explanation cleared it up. The application of multiple g's tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g.
I thought the question on terminal velocity was confusing. I was confused on how to set up the equation so that all the unknown variables would end up cancelling.
I think it was tough to conceptualize some of the drag force problems. Although it's not going to be a heavy focus for the exam, I would've liked to connect more drag force problems to conceptual ideas.
I found the example problem where the guy hits the water very confusing because of dealing with two different  densities.
What was confusing about this lecture was what forces can be considered a centripetal force.  I saw that soletimes it can be the normal force or some other force.

The problem where the person was hitting the water confused me... I thought that because they were entering the water then mg would no longer be acting on them and the only force acting would be drag force
The explanation of deriving the equations was confusing because it moved very quickly.
The terminal velocity question with the difference in air and water density was challenging to see at first.
I was confused on the units for drag force
Today's lesson was not unclear or confusing. The only thing that could have been explained more in depth is centripetal force.
I am still unclear about terminal velocity and when it is used.
the lesson moved really fast for such a complicated topic. deriving the equations was confusing and there weren't enough examples or applications to understand the formulas
i found the centripetal problems a little confusing today. i think I just would like to see it more. besides that it was good.
A hard thing to understand is when a terminal velocity begins and ends when entering or exiting different substances.
The first example of the terminal velocity and the acceleration before the man contacts the water.
I felt that the first group problem was confusing but once we went over it I understood it better
I don't get how velocity changes when you switch between materials.
Not too confused, just a bit worried about the exam next week.
How the drag coefficient density of air and water can be in the same equation simultaneously
circular motion was barely even taught, especially the net force portion
