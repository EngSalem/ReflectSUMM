 The details of what we were supposed to be working on during the studio time. The assignment is long and talked ab things I don’t think we have learned yet 
 Just more information about the project that we were supposed to work on. 
 The assignment of A10 doesn't make a lot of sense as the milestone part is somewhat confusing. 
 In today’s class I think that everything was pretty straightforward. At first I was little confused about the whole process of hydropower and reservoirs, but by the end of the class I totally understood it!
 Today’s class was pretty clear. The discussion about how reservoirs work could have been clearer to help us better understand the process of how the energy is harvested.
 I thought that everything today that was mentioned in class was pretty straightforward. There was nothing that I thought was out of the ordinary today during our lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing today.
 Lots of different due dates
 The assignments that are due was confusing and the milestone 1 and 2 weren’t talked about
 I found the information on the CATME survey to be kind of confusing. I don’t really understand what criticisms I should give my group members because I thought we all did our parts well  
 I wasn’t really confused on anything in today’s class. I think the instructions and tasks were pretty straight forward.
 Nothing, everything was adequately explained in the lecture. The only confusing thing was the original assignment explanation, but it was cleared up.
 i think the assignment 10 could have been better organized and the due dates could have been easier to find
 I would be helpful to have a little more information about how to generate relevant questions to ask clients
 How much detail is needed on these peer evaluations??
 It was confusing when you went over finding data at the start of class, you went through alot of information quickly
 Everything was straight forward I understood everything we were talking about today.
 The most confusing part of today’s lesson was figuring out which part of the technical brief was part of A10 and A12
 All of the deadlines and due dates were a little confusing, as well as the fact that only certain parts of the Taum Sauk tech brief were due.
 I thought that the part about finding information was kind of confusing because it is very difficult to find information about this reservoir that is not about the failure of it. I am confused on where to find data on the Ameren website as well.
 I found that the technical brief template was confusing as I am always unsure of exact specifics of how to format it.
 Everything was understandable.
 How to perform some of the calculations on the assignment given.
 The due dates for the new assignments were very confusing 
 The only thing that needed more details was the breakdown of assignment 10A and 10B
 I found nothing confusing. 
 Nothing needed more details. Maybe a little bit more on how to link google scholar to Purdue libraries. That would have been helpful.
 Nothing was very confusing.
 Nothing was very confusing in today’s class. As we’ve now reached the fourth week of class, I’ve adjusted to the class format and how to complete assignments 
 The class today was simple yet helpful class. I don’t think anything today was confusing. The class had a primary focus and I feel that the class hit the points that needed to be stressed.
 I am having difficulty understanding what the mathematical models mean because I couldn’t find anything that describes these models. 
 It would be nice to have a platform to ask questions durong the presentation
 The new project inteoduction was confusing but then it was better when I read the memo
 I did not understand the APA style of notation. In this class, I have gotten points taken off for having the assignment in APA. I cannot find a resource to how to make these references correctly.

 The class was not confusing at all. All of the concepts that were presented were understood
 We were confused with the assignments for A10. We talked to Jeff Hall and cleared the confusion.
 The date which assignment A10 is due was the most confusing part about the lecture today. In breakout rooms, we talked to our ta about it, and got some clarification, but my the end it was clear.
 I think that APA citing resources could have been covered more to get a better understanding of how to cite APA and where to have sources cited.
 I think that A10 needed more details. I was confused about how to complete some of the models on the assignment. 
 There wasn’t anything too confusing in today’s class, I thought it was pretty straightforward.","In today's lecture, most students understood the content. However, many students had questions about aqssignment 10 -- when is it due and how to complete it. A few students were confused about proper citations, and some were confused about what was required for the peer assessments. Students also wanted more details about how reservoirs work.

My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn't know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
Due dates for assignment 10
i understood everything that the professor spoke about today.
for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.

In today's class I think that everything was pretty straightforward. At first I was little confused about the whole process of hydropower and reservoirs, but by the end of the class I totally understood it!
Today's class was pretty clear. The discussion about how reservoirs work could have been clearer to help us better understand the process of how the energy is harvested.
I thought that everything today that was mentioned in class was pretty straightforward. There was nothing that I thought was out of the ordinary today during our lecture.
I did not find anything confusing today.
Lots of different due dates
The assignments that are due was confusing and the milestone 1 and 2 weren't talked about
I found the information on the CATME survey to be kind of confusing. I don't really understand what criticisms I should give my group members because I thought we all did our parts well
I wasn't really confused on anything in today's class. I think the instructions and tasks were pretty straight forward.
Nothing, everything was adequately explained in the lecture. The only confusing thing was the original assignment explanation, but it was cleared up.
i think the assignment 10 could have been better organized and the due dates could have been easier to find
I would be helpful to have a little more information about how to generate relevant questions to ask clients
How much detail is needed on these peer evaluations??

Everything was straight forward I understood everything we were talking about today.
The most confusing part of today's lesson was figuring out which part of the technical brief was part of A10 and A12
All of the deadlines and due dates were a little confusing, as well as the fact that only certain parts of the Taum Sauk tech brief were due.
I thought that the part about finding information was kind of confusing because it is very difficult to find information about this reservoir that is not about the failure of it. I am confused on where to find data on the Ameren website as well.
I found that the technical brief template was confusing as I am always unsure of exact specifics of how to format it.
Everything was understandable.

The different parts of A010 that were due when
I would have liked a few more details on some of the more open-ended/newer concepts and questions that we will need to figure out.
I believe that there was nothing really confusing about today's class. Information was given really well. 
I was a little confused on how to work a part of the purdue library and google scholar. 
I'm not sure if this is in the plan for Friday, but if we could go through some of the math methods for A10 that would be great. There was nothing terribly confusing in the lecture, but it didn't really cover the thing that I am confused by.
There was nothing confusing or unclear in today's class. There could have been more guidance on how to answer the questions and how to format the answer.
Nothing was very confusing about the class, but I would rather have more time devoted to engineering concepts rather than research and citation making.
Due date for Assignment #10
 I was confused on when we start A11 because it said we started it today in class however I didn't see A11 in 4A Assignments started in class and on the last slide about due dates it said A11 is due at the beginning of 5B
 My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn't know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
 Due dates for assignment 10
 i understood everything that the professor spoke about today.
 for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
 The in class assignment was a little confusing due to lack of instructions on what kind of summary and citation you were looking for.
 How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
 This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
 I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
 I believe that we should have talked more about scholarly materials and how we can use them for information.
 The way the grading for the peer and team assessment was a little unclear. 
 I needed to see the slides that showed how to cite in spa a little longer for the in class assignment.

 There wasn't anything too confusing in today's class, I thought it was pretty straightforward.","Most of the confusion from the lecture came from details regarding assignments, mainly Assignment 10. Many students asked for more details, feedback, or guidance regarding some of the activities they were asked to do. In addition, some students are still having issues in regards to citations and/or setting up their profiles to conduct scholarly work. There were consistent issues when it came to due dates, which ties back heavily to Assignment 10. It would be good to clarify this. Lastly, some students are still having issues with some of the equations and calculations that they were asked to do.","My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. |_| More feedback on our submitted work. |_| I did not understand the APA style of notation.

 I found that the technical brief template was confusing as I am always unsure of exact specifics of how to format it.
 Everything was understandable.
 How to perform some of the calculations on the assignment given.
 The due dates for the new assignments were very confusing 
 The only thing that needed more details was the breakdown of assignment 10A and 10B
 I found nothing confusing. 
 Nothing needed more details. Maybe a little bit more on how to link google scholar to Purdue libraries. That would have been helpful.
 Nothing was very confusing.
 Nothing was very confusing in today’s class. As we’ve now reached the fourth week of class, I’ve adjusted to the class format and how to complete assignments 
 The class today was simple yet helpful class. I don’t think anything today was confusing. The class had a primary focus and I feel that the class hit the points that needed to be stressed.
 I am having difficulty understanding what the mathematical models mean because I couldn’t find anything that describes these models. 
 It would be nice to have a platform to ask questions durong the presentation
 The new project inteoduction was confusing but then it was better when I read the memo
 I did not understand the APA style of notation. In this class, I have gotten points taken off for having the assignment in APA. I cannot find a resource to how to make these references correctly.

 The due date of Assignment 10 and the information needed to complete it.
 The class was not confusing at all. All of the concepts that were presented were understood
 We were confused with the assignments for A10. We talked to Jeff Hall and cleared the confusion.
 The date which assignment A10 is due was the most confusing part about the lecture today. In breakout rooms, we talked to our ta about it, and got some clarification, but my the end it was clear.
 I think that APA citing resources could have been covered more to get a better understanding of how to cite APA and where to have sources cited.
 I think that A10 needed more details. I was confused about how to complete some of the models on the assignment. 
 There wasn’t anything too confusing in today’s class, I thought it was pretty straightforward.","In today's lecture, most students understood the content. However, many students had questions about aqssignment 10 -- when is it due and how to complete it. A few students were confused about proper citations, and some were confused about what was required for the peer assessments. Students also wanted more details about how reservoirs work. Finally, some students expressed confusion about the new project.",The due date of Assignment 10 and the information needed to complete it. I think that APA citing resources could have been covered more to get a better understanding of how to cite APA and where to have sources cited. How much detail is needed on these peer evaluations??

The class was not confusing at all. All of the concepts that were presented were understood
We were confused with the assignments for A10. We talked to Jeff Hall and cleared the confusion.
The date which assignment A10 is due was the most confusing part about the lecture today. In breakout rooms, we talked to our ta about it, and got some clarification, but my the end it was clear.
I think that APA citing resources could have been covered more to get a better understanding of how to cite APA and where to have sources cited.
I think that A10 needed more details. I was confused about how to complete some of the models on the assignment.

More feedback on our submitted work.
The different parts of A010 that were due when
I would have liked a few more details on some of the more open-ended/newer concepts and questions that we will need to figure out.
I believe that there was nothing really confusing about today's class. Information was given really well. 
I was a little confused on how to work a part of the purdue library and google scholar. 
I'm not sure if this is in the plan for Friday, but if we could go through some of the math methods for A10 that would be great. There was nothing terribly confusing in the lecture, but it didn't really cover the thing that I am confused by.
There was nothing confusing or unclear in today's class. There could have been more guidance on how to answer the questions and how to format the answer.
Nothing was very confusing about the class, but I would rather have more time devoted to engineering concepts rather than research and citation making.
Due date for Assignment #10
 I was confused on when we start A11 because it said we started it today in class however I didn't see A11 in 4A Assignments started in class and on the last slide about due dates it said A11 is due at the beginning of 5B
 My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn't know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
 Due dates for assignment 10
 i understood everything that the professor spoke about today.
 for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
 The in class assignment was a little confusing due to lack of instructions on what kind of summary and citation you were looking for.
 How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
 This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
 I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
 I believe that we should have talked more about scholarly materials and how we can use them for information.
 The way the grading for the peer and team assessment was a little unclear. 
 I needed to see the slides that showed how to cite in spa a little longer for the in class assignment. 
 The details of what we were supposed to be working on during the studio time. The assignment is long and talked ab things I don't think we have learned yet 
 Just more information about the project that we were supposed to work on. 
 The assignment of A10 doesn't make a lot of sense as the milestone part is somewhat confusing. 
 In today's class I think that everything was pretty straightforward. At first I was little confused about the whole process of hydropower and reservoirs, but by the end of the class I totally understood it!
 Today's class was pretty clear. The discussion about how reservoirs work could have been clearer to help us better understand the process of how the energy is harvested.

 I wasn't really confused on anything in today's class. I think the instructions and tasks were pretty straight forward.
 Nothing, everything was adequately explained in the lecture. The only confusing thing was the original assignment explanation, but it was cleared up.
 i think the assignment 10 could have been better organized and the due dates could have been easier to find
 I would be helpful to have a little more information about how to generate relevant questions to ask clients
 How much detail is needed on these peer evaluations??
 It was confusing when you went over finding data at the start of class, you went through alot of information quickly
 Everything was straight forward I understood everything we were talking about today.
 The most confusing part of today's lesson was figuring out which part of the technical brief was part of A10 and A12
 All of the deadlines and due dates were a little confusing, as well as the fact that only certain parts of the Taum Sauk tech brief were due.
 I thought that the part about finding information was kind of confusing because it is very difficult to find information about this reservoir that is not about the failure of it. I am confused on where to find data on the Ameren website as well.
 I found that the technical brief template was confusing as I am always unsure of exact specifics of how to format it.

Nothing much. I think I just need to get more comfortable using histograms and understanding how to set them up using excel. -> 2
I feel like everything seemed to be pretty straight forward today! I was not confused about anything today! I felt that we really went over histograms well and it seemed to make sense to me! -> 1
Do i have to use a underflow on my histogram or is it just recommended? -> 2
I think sometimes we are unable to follow the slide or the instruction was not clear enough, so I wish professor could go into detail when performing excel stuff -> 3

A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful. -> 1
I didn’t think anything was confusing even thought I was having computer troubles where I couldn’t heard anything though zoom. Other than that the histograms where explained very well. -> 1
I found some of the histogram making to be somewhat confusing mainly because I was on mac and did not know that I needed to add a tool kit to change the bins and basically the characteristics of the entire graph. -> 2

The in class activity gave my group some confusion because it was not explained in detail, and when breakout rooms opened, we did not understand the entire assignment. -> 3

As I also submitted last class, I would like the option of making questions in the class during the presentation. The thing is that the Raise Hand buttton does not show much, as some peers forget it On. I would like another button, such as the tick, to mean I have a question. Thanks. -> 2
Initially, I was confusing about when exactly the A03 was due, but this was cleared up part way through the lecture. I am however still wondering if I need to e-mail the professor if I turned it in 2 minutes late today from the confusion. This seemed to be an issue across the board. -> 4
nothing was confusing except the bins for the histogram -> 2
I felt comfortable today. -> 1
The specific usage of histograms and how to format them correctly what a little confusing. Also how to sign up for the engineering school videos was still confusing. -> 3

Everything was pretty simple in today’s class. I didn’t really have any questions that I could not answer by reviewing the video and the slides. I am still a little confused on the EYM events. -> 1
I had a hard time creating the bins in excel for assignment 7. Everything else was pretty very clear! -> 4
I was a little confused about what graph to use in the in class activity at first. Since a histogram in my mind would also be able to be used -> 2
Everything was clearly explained. The only confusion was with the assignments we were working on. -> 1
What was most confusing in class today was adjusting the bin width by creating an under flow value because I would have to create a large value to make the bin width an integer and I was not sure if I was doing the correctly. -> 3
Not much was confusing. I understood all the concepts but the only real confusing part was figuring out how to navigate excel correctly. -> 2
Could you send out an email or something to help us keep up with assignments? Also are the before class assignments taken as a grade? -> 3
The instructions for the in class assignment wasn’t posted in the chat until near the end of the breakout room. This made the assignment difficult to complete. -> 3
I am confused on A05. We were not told how to process that much data on excel. I am not sure about how to complete this team assignment because I dont know how to divide this up and complete the assignment -> 4
how to change the bin size from the assigned bins in excel -> 3
I wish that it was easier to see the questions or prompts when we break off into our individual groups because I had trouble working on the in class activity because I didn’t know the prompt -> 1
Great, productive class today. Going a bit slower on the notes would have been nice so I could write the notes. -> 1

I am still confused on how to identify Underflow Bins. -> 4
I found nothing confusing today, everything made sense to me. -> 1
The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped. -> 3
I still am unsure about the differences between categorical and nominal data. Also, when to use what chart. -> 2
The due dates is still confusing. If they were in a more compiled place, it would be extremely helpful. -> 4
I seemed to understand most the material in today’s class. The only thing would be how to keep both ur box width and box number preferences -> 2
The questions we were supposed to answer for the in class activity were not sent so it was difficult to know what were supposed to do in the excel document. -> 4

I was confused about how the in class quiz will work and what it is over. -> 2
Nothing needed more explanation in today’s class. I found everything to be very clear. However, I would have liked to know what kind of chart should have been submitted for the in class activity. -> 1
Nothing much. I think I just need to get more comfortable using histograms and understanding how to set them up using excel. -> 1
I feel like everything seemed to be pretty straight forward today! I was not confused about anything today! I felt that we really went over histograms well and it seemed to make sense to me! -> 1
Do i have to use a underflow on my histogram or is it just recommended? -> 3
I think sometimes we are unable to follow the slide or the instruction was not clear enough, so I wish professor could go into detail when performing excel stuff -> 4
Nothing -> 1
Initially I was a little confused on how to manipulate certain data within the graphs using the tables but eventually I got it sorted out -> 1
I had issues using excel with my Mac, couldn’t find the bins option when making a histogram. I’ve been having similar problems while doing other assignments. -> 2
I’m just having a lot of trouble with excel, and I’m unable to complete many of the assignments due to this. But I’ll figure it out. -> 4
I’m confused on how to find overflow/underflow values. -> 3
I feel as though the theory of histograms was explained well but the implementation of them in excel was a little lacking. -> 3
I was confused for a while because I have a Mac and could not figure out how to change the bin data. I figured out that u can change it by clicking on the value bar itself. It was helpful at the end that professor explained how to add the add on. I wish we were able to reference the slides while in breakout rooms. -> 3
The most confusing part of today’s lesson was trying to determine wether to use a line chart or a histogram. -> 3
Nothing! I feel like I understood it all today and it made sense! -> 1
There is not much things that are confusing or unclear. I understand what we are gonna do and prepare for next class, and the definition and use about histogram is clear enough for me -> 1
I believe class today was very informative. There were definitely some question about histograms that I had answered. -> 1
Everything was pretty clear today. The histograms we worked on were pretty self explanatory -> 1
I am still a little confused on when the career exploration modules/quizzes are due compared to the EYM zoom meetings and attendances. -> 2
I found everything pretty straightforward. I wish we saw the slide you were talking about that had al the due dates so we didn’t have to find it later, but other than that it was good -> 1
A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful. -> 3
I didn’t think anything was confusing even thought I was having computer troubles where I couldn’t heard anything though zoom. Other than that the histograms where explained very well. -> 1
I found some of the histogram making to be somewhat confusing mainly because I was on mac and did not know that I needed to add a tool kit to change the bins and basically the characteristics of the entire graph. -> 4
I think that maybe there could be more information on when you use histograms. I know it’s for distribution but still a little confused on when you use them all. -> 4
There were parts of the directions for A07 that were unclear, like the part about calculating bin widths and using underflow bins. -> 3
Did the homework assignment need a under flow or over flow bin? -> 2
The in class activity gave my group some confusion because it was not explained in detail, and when breakout rooms opened, we did not understand the entire assignment. -> 4
For the in class activity, it was confusing because nobody in my group had a picture of the slides and we didnt have a way to get to them, so we werent sure on what exactly we needed to do. -> 4
As I also submitted last class, I would like the option of making questions in the class during the presentation. The thing is that the Raise Hand buttton does not show much, as some peers forget it On. I would like another button, such as the tick, to mean I have a question. Thanks. -> 2
Initially, I was confusing about when exactly the A03 was due, but this was cleared up part way through the lecture. I am however still wondering if I need to e-mail the professor if I turned it in 2 minutes late today from the confusion. This seemed to be an issue across the board. -> 2
nothing was confusing except the bins for the histogram -> 1
I felt comfortable today. -> 1
The specific usage of histograms and how to format them correctly what a little confusing. Also how to sign up for the engineering school videos was still confusing. -> 3
I think everything was clear in today’s class. I’m starting to get the hang of it which is good so I can get in a routine. -> 1
Everything was pretty simple in today’s class. I didn’t really have any questions that I could not answer by reviewing the video and the slides. I am still a little confused on the EYM events. -> 1
I had a hard time creating the bins in excel for assignment 7. Everything else was pretty very clear! -> 3
I was a little confused about what graph to use in the in class activity at first. Since a histogram in my mind would also be able to be used -> 3
Everything was clearly explained. The only confusion was with the assignments we were working on. -> 1
What was most confusing in class today was adjusting the bin width by creating an under flow value because I would have to create a large value to make the bin width an integer and I was not sure if I was doing the correctly. -> 4
Not much was confusing. I understood all the concepts but the only real confusing part was figuring out how to navigate excel correctly. -> 1
Could you send out an email or something to help us keep up with assignments? Also are the before class assignments taken as a grade? -> 2
The instructions for the in class assignment wasn’t posted in the chat until near the end of the breakout room. This made the assignment difficult to complete. -> 4
I am confused on A05. We were not told how to process that much data on excel. I am not sure about how to complete this team assignment because I dont know how to divide this up and complete the assignment -> 2
how to change the bin size from the assigned bins in excel -> 3
I wish that it was easier to see the questions or prompts when we break off into our individual groups because I had trouble working on the in class activity because I didn’t know the prompt -> 4
Great, productive class today. Going a bit slower on the notes would have been nice so I could write the notes. -> 1

I am still confused on how to identify Underflow Bins. -> 3
I found nothing confusing today, everything made sense to me. -> 1
The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped. -> 4
I still am unsure about the differences between categorical and nominal data. Also, when to use what chart. -> 3
The due dates is still confusing. If they were in a more compiled place, it would be extremely helpful. -> 2
I seemed to understand most the material in today’s class. The only thing would be how to keep both ur box width and box number preferences -> 1
The questions we were supposed to answer for the in class activity were not sent so it was difficult to know what were supposed to do in the excel document. -> 4

 I was confused about how the in class quiz will work and what it is over. 
 As I also submitted last class, I would like the option of making questions in the class during the presentation. The thing is that the Raise Hand buttton does not show much, as some peers forget it On. I would like another button, such as the tick, to mean I have a question. Thanks.
 Some parts of the in class activity were confusing but it was mainly excel stuff
 I did not know what value the histogram needed to be edited at. 
 nothing was confusing except the bins for the histogram
 The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped.
 The due dates is still confusing. If they were in a more compiled place, it would be extremely helpful.
 Everything was clearly explained. The only confusion was with the assignments we were working on.
 Initially, I was confusing about when exactly the A03 was due, but this was cleared up part way through the lecture. I am however still wondering if I need to e-mail the professor if I turned it in 2 minutes late today from the confusion. This seemed to be an issue across the board.
 It was confusing that we had done an assignment on what graph we should use for data analysis but we were taught it today in class.
 I feel as though the theory of histograms was explained well but the implementation of them in excel was a little lacking.
 I am confused on A05. We were not told how to process that much data on excel. I am not sure about how to complete this team assignment because I dont know how to divide this up and complete the assignment 
 There were parts of the directions for A07 that were unclear, like the part about calculating bin widths and using underflow bins. 
 I think everything that was discussed in today’s class was clear, and there was nothing really confusing in today’s class.
 There is not much things that are confusing or unclear. I understand what we are gonna do and prepare for next class, and the definition and use about histogram is clear enough for me","In this lecture, students had trouble calculating, editing, and using bins for histograms in Excel. Additionally, students did not understand how to find or when to use overflow and underflow bins. Students were also unsure about which graph is best for a certain situation, and some expressed difficulty creating and understanding histograms in particular. Finally, students were unclear about due dates and assingment instructions.","Balancing number of bins and bin width A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful. I still am unsure about the differences between categorical and nominal data. Also, when to use what chart. The specific usage of histograms and how to format them correctly what a little confusing. Also how to sign up for the engineering school videos was still confusing.

I am still confused on how to identify Underflow Bins.
I was confused for a while because I have a Mac and could not figure out how to change the bin data. I figured out that u can change it by clicking on the value bar itself. It was helpful at the end that professor explained how to add the add on. I wish we were able to reference the slides while in breakout rooms.

 As I also submitted last class, I would like the option of making questions in the class during the presentation. The thing is that the Raise Hand buttton does not show much, as some peers forget it On. I would like another button, such as the tick, to mean I have a question. Thanks.
 Some parts of the in class activity were confusing but it was mainly excel stuff
 I did not know what value the histogram needed to be edited at. 
 nothing was confusing except the bins for the histogram
 The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped.
 The due dates is still confusing. If they were in a more compiled place, it would be extremely helpful.
 Everything was clearly explained. The only confusion was with the assignments we were working on.
 Initially, I was confusing about when exactly the A03 was due, but this was cleared up part way through the lecture. I am however still wondering if I need to e-mail the professor if I turned it in 2 minutes late today from the confusion. This seemed to be an issue across the board.
 It was confusing that we had done an assignment on what graph we should use for data analysis but we were taught it today in class.
 I feel as though the theory of histograms was explained well but the implementation of them in excel was a little lacking.
 I am confused on A05. We were not told how to process that much data on excel. I am not sure about how to complete this team assignment because I dont know how to divide this up and complete the assignment 
 There were parts of the directions for A07 that were unclear, like the part about calculating bin widths and using underflow bins. 
 I think everything that was discussed in today’s class was clear, and there was nothing really confusing in today’s class.
 There is not much things that are confusing or unclear. I understand what we are gonna do and prepare for next class, and the definition and use about histogram is clear enough for me",A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful. The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it wasquick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I wouldhave hoped. I wish we saw the slide you were talking about that had al the due dates so we didn’t have to find it later The underflow and overflow was confusing for the bins.

Nothing much. I think I just need to get more comfortable using histograms and understanding how to set them up using excel. -> 2

A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful. -> 1
I didn't think anything was confusing even thought I was having computer troubles where I couldn't heard anything though zoom. Other than that the histograms where explained very well. -> 1
I found some of the histogram making to be somewhat confusing mainly because I was on mac and did not know that I needed to add a tool kit to change the bins and basically the characteristics of the entire graph. -> 2
I think that maybe there could be more information on when you use histograms. I know it's for distribution but still a little confused on when you use them all. -> 2
There were parts of the directions for A07 that were unclear, like the part about calculating bin widths and using underflow bins. -> 3
Did the homework assignment need a under flow or over flow bin? -> 1
The in class activity gave my group some confusion because it was not explained in detail, and when breakout rooms opened, we did not understand the entire assignment. -> 3
For the in class activity, it was confusing because nobody in my group had a picture of the slides and we didnt have a way to get to them, so we werent sure on what exactly we needed to do. -> 1
As I also submitted last class, I would like the option of making questions in the class during the presentation. The thing is that the Raise Hand buttton does not show much, as some peers forget it On. I would like another button, such as the tick, to mean I have a question. Thanks. -> 2
Initially, I was confusing about when exactly the A03 was due, but this was cleared up part way through the lecture. I am however still wondering if I need to e-mail the professor if I turned it in 2 minutes late today from the confusion. This seemed to be an issue across the board. -> 4
nothing was confusing except the bins for the histogram -> 2
I felt comfortable today. -> 1
The specific usage of histograms and how to format them correctly what a little confusing. Also how to sign up for the engineering school videos was still confusing. -> 3
I think everything was clear in today's class. I'm starting to get the hang of it which is good so I can get in a routine. -> 1
Everything was pretty simple in today's class. I didn't really have any questions that I could not answer by reviewing the video and the slides. I am still a little confused on the EYM events. -> 1
I had a hard time creating the bins in excel for assignment 7. Everything else was pretty very clear! -> 4
I was a little confused about what graph to use in the in class activity at first. Since a histogram in my mind would also be able to be used -> 2
Everything was clearly explained. The only confusion was with the assignments we were working on. -> 1
What was most confusing in class today was adjusting the bin width by creating an under flow value because I would have to create a large value to make the bin width an integer and I was not sure if I was doing the correctly. -> 3
Not much was confusing. I understood all the concepts but the only real confusing part was figuring out how to navigate excel correctly. -> 2
Could you send out an email or something to help us keep up with assignments? Also are the before class assignments taken as a grade? -> 3
The instructions for the in class assignment wasn't posted in the chat until near the end of the breakout room. This made the assignment difficult to complete. -> 3
I am confused on A05. We were not told how to process that much data on excel. I am not sure about how to complete this team assignment because I dont know how to divide this up and complete the assignment -> 4
how to change the bin size from the assigned bins in excel -> 3
I wish that it was easier to see the questions or prompts when we break off into our individual groups because I had trouble working on the in class activity because I didn't know the prompt -> 1
Great, productive class today. Going a bit slower on the notes would have been nice so I could write the notes. -> 1

I am still confused on how to identify Underflow Bins. -> 4
I found nothing confusing today, everything made sense to me. -> 1
The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped. -> 3
I still am unsure about the differences between categorical and nominal data. Also, when to use what chart. -> 2
The due dates is still confusing. If they were in a more compiled place, it would be extremely helpful. -> 4
I seemed to understand most the material in today's class. The only thing would be how to keep both ur box width and box number preferences -> 2
The questions we were supposed to answer for the in class activity were not sent so it was difficult to know what were supposed to do in the excel document. -> 4
I think everything that was discussed in today's class was clear, and there was nothing really confusing in today's class. -> 1

It was confusing that we had done an assignment on what graph we should use for data analysis but we were taught it today in class. -> 3
I was confused by all the due dates and the way the bright space is set up. I forgot to do assignment A06 because it wasn't in the “To Do before class” category for class 4A -> 2

Nothing much. I think I just need to get more comfortable using histograms and understanding how to set them up using excel. -> 1
I feel like everything seemed to be pretty straight forward today! I was not confused about anything today! I felt that we really went over histograms well and it seemed to make sense to me! -> 1
Do i have to use a underflow on my histogram or is it just recommended? -> 3

I feel as though the theory of histograms was explained well but the implementation of them in excel was a little lacking. -> 3
I was confused for a while because I have a Mac and could not figure out how to change the bin data. I figured out that u can change it by clicking on the value bar itself.

how to change the bin size from the assigned bins in excel 
I found everything pretty straightforward. I wish we saw the slide you were talking about that had al the due dates so we didn't have to find it later, but other than that it was good
I am still a little confused on when the career exploration modules/quizzes are due compared to the EYM zoom meetings and attendances.
Nothing was confusing because it was just a rehash of the Brightspace modules.
I believe class today was very informative. There were definitely some question about histograms that I had answered. 
I was confused by all the due dates and the way the bright space is set up. I forgot to do assignment A06 because it wasn't in the “To Do before class” category for class 4A
I had a hard time creating the bins in excel for assignment 7. Everything else was pretty very clear! 
Nothing was confusing
 It was confusing that we were reviewing what types of graphs were correct for a situation when we had already submitted an assignment with our choices of what graphs we thought best displayed data.
 The in class activity gave my group some confusion because it was not explained in detail, and when breakout rooms opened, we did not understand the entire assignment.
 Nothing! I feel like I understood it all today and it made sense! 
 I am still confused on how to identify Underflow Bins. 
 I was confused for a while because I have a Mac and could not figure out how to change the bin data. I figured out that u can change it by clicking on the value bar itself. It was helpful at the end that professor explained how to add the add on. I wish we were able to reference the slides while in breakout rooms.
 I'm confused on how to find overflow/underflow values.
 I had issues using excel with my Mac, couldn't find the bins option when making a histogram. I've been having similar problems while doing other assignments.
 There was nothing confusing in the class today for me. I thought everything was explained very well.
 More in depth about how to make more complicated histograms
 i didn't understand that the histograms didn't need the date so i spent the whole break out room confused. I also think the breakout rooms should've been longer.
 It's a little confusing on knowing which graph or chart to use or if you can use more than one. 
 Do i have to use a underflow on my histogram or is it just recommended? 
 Nothing really was confusing to me today. 
 The questions we were supposed to answer for the in class activity were not sent so it was difficult to know what were supposed to do in the excel document.
 I didn't think anything was confusing even thought I was having computer troubles where I couldn't heard anything though zoom. Other than that the histograms where explained very well.
 I think sometimes we are unable to follow the slide or the instruction was not clear enough, so I wish professor could go into detail when performing excel stuff 
 Everything was pretty clear today. The histograms we worked on were pretty self explanatory
 I still am unsure about the differences between categorical and nominal data. Also, when to use what chart. 
 I seemed to understand most the material in today's class. The only thing would be how to keep both ur box width and box number preferences 
 Could you send out an email or something to help us keep up with assignments? Also are the before class assignments taken as a grade?
 Nothing much. I think I just need to get more comfortable using histograms and understanding how to set them up using excel.
 I feel like everything seemed to be pretty straight forward today! I was not confused about anything today! I felt that we really went over histograms well and it seemed to make sense to me! 
 The specific usage of histograms and how to format them correctly what a little confusing. Also how to sign up for the engineering school videos was still confusing. 
 I found some of the histogram making to be somewhat confusing mainly because I was on mac and did not know that I needed to add a tool kit to change the bins and basically the characteristics of the entire graph. 
 Initially I was a little confused on how to manipulate certain data within the graphs using the tables but eventually I got it sorted out
 Balancing number of bins and bin width
 Nothing needed more explanation in today's class. I found everything to be very clear. However, I would have liked to know what kind of chart should have been submitted for the in class activity. 
 I'm just having a lot of trouble with excel, and I'm unable to complete many of the assignments due to this. But I'll figure it out.
 nothing
 Nothing was confusing today. I have a good understanding of using histograms in excel. 
 What was most confusing in class today was adjusting the bin width by creating an under flow value because I would have to create a large value to make the bin width an integer and I was not sure if I was doing the correctly.
 Great, productive class today. Going a bit slower on the notes would have been nice so I could write the notes. 
 For the in class activity, it was confusing because nobody in my group had a picture of the slides and we didnt have a way to get to them, so we werent sure on what exactly we needed to do.
 I think everything was clear in today's class. I'm starting to get the hang of it which is good so I can get in a routine.

 The most confusing part of today's lesson was trying to determine wether to use a line chart or a histogram.
 The lecture didn't confuse me at all, but when we started assignment A07, I couldn't figure out how to correctly change the bin widths.
 Everything was pretty simple in today's class. I didn't really have any questions that I could not answer by reviewing the video and the slides. I am still a little confused on the EYM events.
 Not much was confusing. I understood all the concepts but the only real confusing part was figuring out how to navigate excel correctly.
 The underflow and overflow was confusing for the bins.
 I felt comfortable today.
 I was a little confused about what graph to use in the in class activity at first. Since a histogram in my mind would also be able to be used
 How to make a histogram properly in excel. If you showed us an example of making it in excel that would be helpful. Excel is new to everyone and it can be tricky to use it. 
 I found nothing confusing today, everything made sense to me.
 I think that maybe there could be more information on when you use histograms. I know it's for distribution but still a little confused on when you use them all.
 Did the homework assignment need a under flow or over flow bin?
 The instructions for the in class assignment wasn't posted in the chat until near the end of the breakout room. This made the assignment difficult to complete.
 I didn't find anything confusing during class. I felt that the presentation and class overall moved at consistent and helpful speed and everything was related in a non-confusing manner.
 I wish that it was easier to see the questions or prompts when we break off into our individual groups because I had trouble working on the in class activity because I didn't know the prompt
 I was confused about how the in class quiz will work and what it is over. 
 As I also submitted last class, I would like the option of making questions in the class during the presentation. The thing is that the Raise Hand buttton does not show much, as some peers forget it On. I would like another button, such as the tick, to mean I have a question. Thanks.
 Some parts of the in class activity were confusing but it was mainly excel stuff
 I did not know what value the histogram needed to be edited at. 
 nothing was confusing except the bins for the histogram
 The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped.
 The due dates is still confusing. If they were in a more compiled place, it would be extremely helpful.
 Everything was clearly explained. The only confusion was with the assignments we were working on.
 Initially, I was confusing about when exactly the A03 was due, but this was cleared up part way through the lecture. I am however still wondering if I need to e-mail the professor if I turned it in 2 minutes late today from the confusion. This seemed to be an issue across the board.
 It was confusing that we had done an assignment on what graph we should use for data analysis but we were taught it today in class.

I found the z table most interesting because it's on easy way to find z value from data.
What was interesting in today's class was learning some more about z values
I thought it was interesting to try and learn real world applications of the statistical concepts we were learning.
Today most interesting thing that I found was working together with my team and start doing assignments together.
The z-product stuff was interesting to me because it incorporates math in a sense with area under a curve.
using z scores and normal curves to figure out probabilities
I found the histogram data interpretation interesting.
The most interesting aspect of today's class was defiantly learning the ability to compute the z-score. I think this will be a very valuable resource
It was interesting how we can use the bell curve graphs to talk about probability.
Remembering how to do Z-scores
Everything else was Interesting
One topic I found most interesting from today's class was how histograms can be used for probability.
The most interesting thing today was in relation to standard deviation table.
I found how to find the probability of skittles interesting and that we have assignment 5 due Wednesday very interesting!
The breakout rooms were good
I actually find the excel histograms very interesting!
I found the z scores way of analyzing the chart area interesting with its calculus.
I found how we can use histograms and z-scores to determine the probability of certain things happening in data sets
The fact that you can use histograms to solve probability problems.
The function of the z-score
I enjoyed learning how to input data in a team.
I enjoyed working with my group to complete the assignments because we got to work together and finish the work as a group
The thing that I found most interesting was the just the projects in general. Studio time was interesting and I find it interesting how the team is starting to feel more comfortable with each other.
The statistics.
It was interesting to learn more about histograms and how they can be used
As always I like when we can participate even with polls or talking in class.
How extensively a histogram can be used- I originally believed it was an equivalent to a bar chart but with histograms we can do a variety of calculations and interpretations which was very interesting since I never expected it.
How much data excel can handle so quickly
I found finding the z score very interesting
The normal curve was interesting to me because of the empirical rule which showed the percentages ofbthe data covered by each standard deviation of the curve.
Like the previous classes, I love talking to my group and making sure everyone knows what their responsibilities are!!
zscore and how it can be used to find probability and such
We were able to count skittles as a little activity and I feel like that was the most interesting thing this class
I liked the idea of including us into counting the skittles to formulate our data however I didn't see how it connected to the rest of class because we didn't use it at all
I found it interesting to work on assignment 5 with my team and discuss our ideas for recommendations
Learning how to use the z score and putting it in practice
I found finding the probability using the histograms really interesting. It's helpful to know that the x axis in histograms can be changed to percentages to better interpret the data.
How powerful the excel can do.
I found it interesting to see z-scores, which i already knew about as i took ap Statistics during my senior year in high school. I also thought that finding out about the myu and standard deviation was fun to learn about.
What I found most interesting in today's class was the differences between using histograms with less frequencies for the probability and how that differs from using the normalized method or a graph with a higher number of frequencies.","I enjoyed discussing z scores and how they can be used to calculate probability. This is a very useful and practical skill that can be applied in many ways. It is nice to have a class which goes over how to use them and apply them.

Learning about z scores and how mean and standard deviation relate
What I found interesting about today's class was how easy probability can be calculated when looking at a normal histogram. 
I found the usefulness of z-scores interesting and how they work.
Today I enjoyed learning about the z scores and probability because statistics was always interesting to me in high school and I enjoy learning about it.
I found that being able to convert any sort of distribution to a normal distribution was interesting.

Calculating z values 
The fact that our data is used for next class is pretty interesting because we the students are part of the data we work with.
Going over the due dates for the upcoming assignments 
 I liked the addition of probability, the normal curve and z scores to our class. I feel that is going to be helpful in the future.
 The z scores and probability was well explained especially with the little bit of new material.
 i found it interesting to work in breakout rooms and talk to my teammates.
 I found interesting the application of real life products like skittles to probability and standard distribution.
 I really like the Skittles assignment.
 The different data that we were using to do the skittles project 
 How a normal curve in a histogram can be transformed into a frequency percentage
 z-scores can help to find probability of certain events. 
 The use of z-scores
 Skittle activity was fun to do.
 I really liked the breakout rooms because it felt like my group accomplished a lot and asked questions when needed. I also felt like the Z score information was helpful because it cleared up some confusion from the “complete before class” module.
 I found the time spent working with my group and getting to know them better was most interesting. 
 I found it interesting how the normal distribution and the standard deviation/z score can be used to find the probability of certain events occurring. 
 I found the idea of finding probability through z scores very interesting. I am not used to working with histograms and enjoy the many benefits of using them over a regular chart. 
 I enjoyed learning about standardization as it seems like it will be very useful in interpreting data and calculating probability. It was also fun to solve the skittles problem using this new method.
 The connection of probability and histograms was very interesting to me.
 Skittles are weird
 The z data as well as the chart of percentages was interesting and seems like a very useful tool.
 I really enjoyed learning about Z scores and probability. I liked how you showed us how we can use probability to find interesting statistics. 
 Today's assignment 8 was very interesting and easy to understand. 
 The application of z scores was interesting to see how it is used to create predictions and see trends
 using Z score chart was the most interesting
 I found the skittles to be a fun and interesting example of how to use our skills to actually do something.
 I learned more about the applications of Z-score and the breakdown of how it is used. 
 I thought that the z-score was the most interesting part, considering the table seems very easy and straightforward to use.

I found it interesting to see z-scores, which i already knew about as i took ap Statistics during my senior year in high school. I also thought that finding out about the myu and standard deviation was fun to learn about.
What I found most interesting in today’s class was the differences between using histograms with less frequencies for the probability and how that differs from using the normalized method or a graph with a higher number of frequencies.","I enjoyed discussing z scores and how they can be used to calculate probability. This is a very useful and practical skill that can be applied in many ways. It is nice to have a class which goes over how to use them and apply them.
skittles 
Learning about z scores and how mean and standard deviation relate
What I found interesting about today’s class was how easy probability can be calculated when looking at a normal histogram. 
I found the usefulness of z-scores interesting and how they work.
Today I enjoyed learning about the z scores and probability because statistics was always interesting to me in high school and I enjoy learning about it.
I found that being able to convert any sort of distribution to a normal distribution was interesting.

Calculating z values 
The fact that our data is used for next class is pretty interesting because we the students are part of the data we work with.
Going over the due dates for the upcoming assignments 
 I liked the addition of probability, the normal curve and z scores to our class. I feel that is going to be helpful in the future.
 The z scores and probability was well explained especially with the little bit of new material.
 i found it interesting to work in breakout rooms and talk to my teammates.
 I found interesting the application of real life products like skittles to probability and standard distribution.
 I really like the Skittles assignment.
 The different data that we were using to do the skittles project 
 How a normal curve in a histogram can be transformed into a frequency percentage
 z-scores can help to find probability of certain events. 
 The use of z-scores
 Skittle activity was fun to do.
 I really liked the breakout rooms because it felt like my group accomplished a lot and asked questions when needed. I also felt like the Z score information was helpful because it cleared up some confusion from the “complete before class” module.
 I found the time spent working with my group and getting to know them better was most interesting. 
 I found it interesting how the normal distribution and the standard deviation/z score can be used to find the probability of certain events occurring. 
 I found the idea of finding probability through z scores very interesting. I am not used to working with histograms and enjoy the many benefits of using them over a regular chart. 
 I enjoyed learning about standardization as it seems like it will be very useful in interpreting data and calculating probability. It was also fun to solve the skittles problem using this new method.
 The connection of probability and histograms was very interesting to me.
 Skittles are weird
 The z data as well as the chart of percentages was interesting and seems like a very useful tool.
 I really enjoyed learning about Z scores and probability. I liked how you showed us how we can use probability to find interesting statistics. 
 Today’s assignment 8 was very interesting and easy to understand. 
 The application of z scores was interesting to see how it is used to create predictions and see trends
 using Z score chart was the most interesting
 I found the skittles to be a fun and interesting example of how to use our skills to actually do something.
 I learned more about the applications of Z-score and the breakdown of how it is used. 
 I thought that the z-score was the most interesting part, considering the table seems very easy and straightforward to use.
 Histogram uses in excel
 The most interesting part of today’s class was learning about the probability aspects of a histogram and everything about z scores and stuff.
 I found the z table most interesting because it’s on easy way to find z value from data.
 What was interesting in today’s class was learning some more about z values
 I thought it was interesting to try and learn real world applications of the statistical concepts we were learning. 
 Today most interesting thing that I found was working together with my team and start doing assignments together. 
 The z-product stuff was interesting to me because it incorporates math in a sense with area under a curve.
 using z scores and normal curves to figure out probabilities
 I found the histogram data interpretation interesting.
 The most interesting aspect of today’s class was defiantly learning the ability to compute the z-score. I think this will be a very valuable resource
 It was interesting how we can use the bell curve graphs to talk about probability. 
 Remembering how to do Z-scores
 Everything else was Interesting 
 One topic I found most interesting from today’s class was how histograms can be used for probability. 
 The most interesting thing today was in relation to standard deviation table. 
 I found how to find the probability of skittles interesting and that we have assignment 5 due Wednesday very interesting! 
 The breakout rooms were good
 I actually find the excel histograms very interesting!
 I found the z scores way of analyzing the chart area interesting with its calculus. 
 I found how we can use histograms and z-scores to determine the probability of certain things happening in data sets 
 The fact that you can use histograms to solve probability problems.
 The function of the z-score
 I enjoyed learning how to input data in a team.
 I enjoyed working with my group to complete the assignments because we got to work together and finish the work as a group
 The thing that I found most interesting was the just the projects in general. Studio time was interesting and I find it interesting how the team is starting to feel more comfortable with each other.
 The statistics.
 It was interesting to learn more about histograms and how they can be used
 As always I like when we can participate even with polls or talking in class. 
 How extensively a histogram can be used- I originally believed it was an equivalent to a bar chart but with histograms we can do a variety of calculations and interpretations which was very interesting since I never expected it. 
 How much data excel can handle so quickly
 I found finding the z score very interesting
 The normal curve was interesting to me because of the empirical rule which showed the percentages ofbthe data covered by each standard deviation of the curve.
 Like the previous classes, I love talking to my group and making sure everyone knows what their responsibilities are!!
 zscore and how it can be used to find probability and such
 We were able to count skittles as a little activity and I feel like that was the most interesting thing this class
 I liked the idea of including us into counting the skittles to formulate our data however I didn’t see how it connected to the rest of class because we didn’t use it at all 
 I found it interesting to work on assignment 5 with my team and discuss our ideas for recommendations
 Learning how to use the z score and putting it in practice 
 I found finding the probability using the histograms really interesting. It’s helpful to know that the x axis in histograms can be changed to percentages to better interpret the data.

I thought that the z-score was the most interesting part, considering the table seems very easy and straightforward to use.
Histogram uses in excel
The most interesting part of today’s class was learning about the probability aspects of a histogram and everything about z scores and stuff.
I found the z table most interesting because it’s on easy way to find z value from data.
What was interesting in today’s class was learning some more about z values
I thought it was interesting to try and learn real world applications of the statistical concepts we were learning.
Today most interesting thing that I found was working together with my team and start doing assignments together.
The z-product stuff was interesting to me because it incorporates math in a sense with area under a curve.
using z scores and normal curves to figure out probabilities
I found the histogram data interpretation interesting.
The most interesting aspect of today’s class was defiantly learning the ability to compute the z-score. I think this will be a very valuable resource
It was interesting how we can use the bell curve graphs to talk about probability.
Remembering how to do Z-scores
Everything else was Interesting
One topic I found most interesting from today’s class was how histograms can be used for probability.
The most interesting thing today was in relation to standard deviation table.
I found how to find the probability of skittles interesting and that we have assignment 5 due Wednesday very interesting!
The breakout rooms were good
I actually find the excel histograms very interesting!
I found the z scores way of analyzing the chart area interesting with its calculus.
I found how we can use histograms and z-scores to determine the probability of certain things happening in data sets
The fact that you can use histograms to solve probability problems.
The function of the z-score
I enjoyed learning how to input data in a team.
I enjoyed working with my group to complete the assignments because we got to work together and finish the work as a group
The thing that I found most interesting was the just the projects in general. Studio time was interesting and I find it interesting how the team is starting to feel more comfortable with each other.
The statistics.
It was interesting to learn more about histograms and how they can be used
As always I like when we can participate even with polls or talking in class.
How extensively a histogram can be used- I originally believed it was an equivalent to a bar chart but with histograms we can do a variety of calculations and interpretations which was very interesting since I never expected it.
How much data excel can handle so quickly
I found finding the z score very interesting
The normal curve was interesting to me because of the empirical rule which showed the percentages ofbthe data covered by each standard deviation of the curve.
Like the previous classes, I love talking to my group and making sure everyone knows what their responsibilities are!!
zscore and how it can be used to find probability and such
We were able to count skittles as a little activity and I feel like that was the most interesting thing this class
I liked the idea of including us into counting the skittles to formulate our data however I didn’t see how it connected to the rest of class because we didn’t use it at all
I found it interesting to work on assignment 5 with my team and discuss our ideas for recommendations
Learning how to use the z score and putting it in practice
I found finding the probability using the histograms really interesting. It’s helpful to know that the x axis in histograms can be changed to percentages to better interpret the data.
How powerful the excel can do.
I found it interesting to see z-scores, which i already knew about as i took ap Statistics during my senior year in high school. I also thought that finding out about the myu and standard deviation was fun to learn about.
What I found most interesting in today’s class was the differences between using histograms with less frequencies for the probability and how that differs from using the normalized method or a graph with a higher number of frequencies.","I enjoyed discussing z scores and how they can be used to calculate probability. This is a very useful and practical skill that can be applied in many ways. It is nice to have a class which goes over how to use them and apply them.
skittles 
Learning about z scores and how mean and standard deviation relate
What I found interesting about today’s class was how easy probability can be calculated when looking at a normal histogram. 
I found the usefulness of z-scores interesting and how they work.
Today I enjoyed learning about the z scores and probability because statistics was always interesting to me in high school and I enjoy learning about it.
I found that being able to convert any sort of distribution to a normal distribution was interesting.

Calculating z values 
The fact that our data is used for next class is pretty interesting because we the students are part of the data we work with.
Going over the due dates for the upcoming assignments 
 I liked the addition of probability, the normal curve and z scores to our class. I feel that is going to be helpful in the future.
 The z scores and probability was well explained especially with the little bit of new material.
 i found it interesting to work in breakout rooms and talk to my teammates.
 I found interesting the application of real life products like skittles to probability and standard distribution.
 I really like the Skittles assignment.
 The different data that we were using to do the skittles project 
 How a normal curve in a histogram can be transformed into a frequency percentage
 z-scores can help to find probability of certain events. 
 The use of z-scores
 Skittle activity was fun to do.
 I really liked the breakout rooms because it felt like my group accomplished a lot and asked questions when needed. I also felt like the Z score information was helpful because it cleared up some confusion from the “complete before class” module.
 I found the time spent working with my group and getting to know them better was most interesting. 
 I found it interesting how the normal distribution and the standard deviation/z score can be used to find the probability of certain events occurring. 
 I found the idea of finding probability through z scores very interesting. I am not used to working with histograms and enjoy the many benefits of using them over a regular chart. 
 I enjoyed learning about standardization as it seems like it will be very useful in interpreting data and calculating probability. It was also fun to solve the skittles problem using this new method.
 The connection of probability and histograms was very interesting to me.
 Skittles are weird
 The z data as well as the chart of percentages was interesting and seems like a very useful tool.

 I found how we can use histograms and z-scores to determine the probability of certain things happening in data sets 
 The fact that you can use histograms to solve probability problems.
 The function of the z-score
 I enjoyed learning how to input data in a team.
 I enjoyed working with my group to complete the assignments because we got to work together and finish the work as a group
 The thing that I found most interesting was the just the projects in general. Studio time was interesting and I find it interesting how the team is starting to feel more comfortable with each other.
 The statistics.
 It was interesting to learn more about histograms and how they can be used
 As always I like when we can participate even with polls or talking in class. 
 How extensively a histogram can be used- I originally believed it was an equivalent to a bar chart but with histograms we can do a variety of calculations and interpretations which was very interesting since I never expected it. 
 How much data excel can handle so quickly
 I found finding the z score very interesting
 The normal curve was interesting to me because of the empirical rule which showed the percentages ofbthe data covered by each standard deviation of the curve.
 Like the previous classes, I love talking to my group and making sure everyone knows what their responsibilities are!!
 zscore and how it can be used to find probability and such
 We were able to count skittles as a little activity and I feel like that was the most interesting thing this class
 I liked the idea of including us into counting the skittles to formulate our data however I didn’t see how it connected to the rest of class because we didn’t use it at all 
 I found it interesting to work on assignment 5 with my team and discuss our ideas for recommendations
 Learning how to use the z score and putting it in practice 
 I found finding the probability using the histograms really interesting. It’s helpful to know that the x axis in histograms can be changed to percentages to better interpret the data.
 How powerful the excel can do. 
 I found it interesting to see z-scores, which i already knew about as i took ap Statistics during my senior year in high school. I also thought that finding out about the myu and standard deviation was fun to learn about. 
 What I found most interesting in today’s class was the differences between using histograms with less frequencies for the probability and how that differs from using the normalized method or a graph with a higher number of frequencies.",I enjoyed discussing z scores and how they can be used to calculate probability. This is a very useful and practical skill that can be applied in many ways. It is nice to have a class which goes over how to use them and apply them. I really liked the breakout rooms because it felt like my group accomplished a lot and asked questions when needed. I also felt like the Z score information was helpful because it cleared up some confusion from the “complete before class” module. I found the idea of finding probability through z scores very interesting. I am not used to working with histograms and enjoy the many benefits of using them over a regular chart. I found interesting the application of real life products like skittles to probability and standard distribution. I found that being able to convert any sort of distribution to a normal distribution was interesting.,"Z-scores (or z-values, z-product, z chart, z table, z data)

 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn't find anything about this lecture confusing.
 How to search for data quickly.
 The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
 What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
 Something that needed more detail in today's class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). Information on Laminar Flow and other topics that others may not know about can be explained, even if briefly, to help give a general idea of the topic to the students.","Many students are confused about Assignment 10. It would be useful to go over the details and the expectations of the Assignment. There also appears to be some issues with the activity regarding citations scholarly work.

Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn’t really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn’t have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn’t completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can’t do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today’s class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
 The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
 N/A
 The directions for A10 weren’t as clear as they could have been, since it wasn’t noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
 My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. 
 What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
 Nothing in today’s class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn’t that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I’m not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today’s class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn’t sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat.

What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class.

 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can’t use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
 Something that needed more detail in today’s class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). Information on Laminar Flow and other topics that others may not know about can be explained, even if briefly, to help give a general idea of the topic to the students.","In this lecture, students were confused about how to complete assignment A10. Additionally and more specifically, students were confused by how to use the Laminar approach and how to employ mathematical models in this assignment. Similarly, students were confused about how to complete the in-class activity and what was being asked; some needed more time. Students also had questions about how to find and cite reliable sources and what sources are acceptable for use. Finally, students wanted more background on the Taum Sauk reservoir and how hydroelectric dams work in general.","i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing. I didn’t really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I’m not sure what that is. What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions. There wasn’t anything too particularly confusing in today’s class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.","Assignment 10, A10

What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams.
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments.
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.

Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class.
There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.

Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class -> 1
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too? -> 3
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief. -> 4
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project. -> 3
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics. -> 1
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations. -> 3
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. -> 5
I didn’t really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. -> 3
I didn’t have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn’t completely clear to me. -> 4
i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing. -> 4
I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can’t do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. -> 3
Everything explained was clear. -> 1
I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. -> 2
I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest -> 2
Explanation for what the client memo was outlining -> 2
since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing -> 1
Something that needed more detail in today’s class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases. -> 1

Nothing in today’s class was especially confusing. -> 1
Nothing -> 1
Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected. -> 3
I am confused how the laminar approach works. -> 3
I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help -> 4
The citation part was confusing. -> 2
A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out. -> 2

I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given. -> 1
Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. -> 3
The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn’t that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was. -> 4
While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I’m not sure what that is. -> 3
Something that was confusing in today’s class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn’t sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. -> 1
I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn’t understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. -> 3
I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class. -> 3
Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand -> 4
the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it -> 3
I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn’t necessarily confused by any particular part of today’s class. -> 1
There wasn’t anything too particularly confusing in today’s class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this. -> 3
Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir. -> 2
How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades -> 5
Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing -> 4
One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations. -> 3
I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. -> 4
Nothing was confusing to me today. -> 1
Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. -> 2
I didn’t find anything about this lecture confusing. -> 1
How to search for data quickly. -> 3
The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification. -> 3
What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group? -> 2
Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment. -> 3
Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. -> 1
The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. -> 1
I didn't find anything confusing today. -> 1
It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone. -> 3
What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data -> 4
I was confused on parts of assignment A10 -> 2
I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward. -> 3
Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns. -> 2
I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right. -> 3
Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b. -> 2
I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that -> 1
nothing -> 1
What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can’t use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. -> 4
how to use the outside resources information in the research -> 1
I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment. -> 2
Something that needed more detail in today’s class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10).

Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams.
I didn’t really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments.
I didn’t have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn’t completely clear to me.

Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
I am confused how the laminar approach works.
I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
The citation part was confusing.
A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear.
The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn’t that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I’m not sure what that is.
Something that was confusing in today’s class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn’t sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat.
I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn’t understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models.
I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn’t necessarily confused by any particular part of today’s class.
There wasn’t anything too particularly confusing in today’s class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.

Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn’t really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn’t have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn’t completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can’t do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today’s class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
 The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
 N/A
 The directions for A10 weren’t as clear as they could have been, since it wasn’t noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
 My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. 
 What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
 Nothing in today’s class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn’t that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I’m not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today’s class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn’t sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn’t understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn’t necessarily confused by any particular part of today’s class. 
 There wasn’t anything too particularly confusing in today’s class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn’t find anything about this lecture confusing.
 How to search for data quickly.
 The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
 What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can’t use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
 Something that needed more detail in today’s class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). Information on Laminar Flow and other topics that others may not know about can be explained, even if briefly, to help give a general idea of the topic to the students.","i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing. I didn’t really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments.

Much was very thorough and clear. I had some issues understanding the diagrams at first, not sure why. Seems a few others were confused with how to interpret the diagram as well. Nevertheless, it was a good self problem solving period. and when the prof explained, it was clear and well executed. I understood more being confused and then being enlightened and shown how the diagram was supposed to represent the particles and their charges. furthermore, after the first diagram it seemed like I felt I was absorbing s a lotmore from the concepts you were trying to get through to us.
I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem.
What I found unclear was the lightbulb lighting up due to the work done by the professor. It was stated that the work done caused the lightbulb to light up and the electrons moving into the lightbulb.

What I found unclear was the lightbulb lighting up due to the work done by the professor. It was stated that the work done caused the lightbulb to light up and the electrons moving into the lightbulb.
The uses for coulombs law in specific 
In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works. 
The idea of grounding was unclear to me. I did not understand how charge can be left over in a particle after it has been grounded.
Overall, today's class was really good! I thought that each tophat question was well explained. I was a little confused with some of the math steps you took in simplifying, because you never showed any conversions, but the whole concept was clear.
I thought some of the problems we did in class were confusing. I did end up finding the right answers but I think the explanation in class could've been more in-depth.
 I was a bit confused with the concept question on tophat about the ratio of charges, but after explaining, it made more sense. 
 I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me. 
 I was confused about how the energy from Dr. Nero was what caused the lightbulb to light up in the experiment.
 The beginning of the lecture about charges was a bit rushed and I think it would be a valuable thing to go over since it is the building blocks of electric forces
 i enjoyed today's class. i struggled when all the forces were being applied onto the one force. i didn't understand this because i couldn't seem to figure out why that one force just became 0. 
 I think today's class was good. The breakout rooms did help me meet some new students. I was also able to understand the content well, as I solved the questions on my own before the professor. It would be great if we could have Q n A sometime during lecture. 
 I was confused about the way to break up the components in the last problem. I forgot about vector math from physics 1. The breakout room for one of the problems was not helpful, my group did not participate.
 I was a little bit confused on Shell Theorems in today's class because the two Theorems seem to be very similar and I'm having trouble understanding the difference between the two. 
 I felt that the lecture was well explained. I believe that one would only find it confusing if they didn't watch the prerecorded lectures before hand. 
 Coulomb's law Shell Theorems
 I found the second shell theorem to be confusing. Is there no electric force on the particle because the shell it is in is charged? ","Many of the students in today's lecture had trouble with the in class questions and tophat questions.
