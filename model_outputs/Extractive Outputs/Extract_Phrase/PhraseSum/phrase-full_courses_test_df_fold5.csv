 I found it interesting how easy it was to organize data into a histogram.
 Determining what graphs to use for what situations was quite interesting.
 Giving a problem and deciding which chart to use based off the variables 
 I think using excel is interesting. 
 I found discussing the different types of graphed and discussing when we should use them most helpful and interesting. I liked that this discussion was interactive.
 Excel is such a powerful tool and can evaluate data so quickly. 
 it was interesting making the histograms, it was difficult finding an underflow bin but i feel like i am getting the hang of excel
 The different types of graphs is pretty interesting. They all have different uses and having the flow chart you showed in class is very helpful and interesting. 
 histograms 
 The most interesting part of today’s class was learning about how to calculate bins and bin width and what the purpose of histograms are.
 I found it interesting how much less data you need to create a histogram.
 I found histograms and their usefulness interesting. I thought the information you could gather from them was extensive and useful.
 I found learning about histograms and how they can show frequency of data to be interesting. I see how useful they can be for data analytics. 
 The break out rooms were interesting. 
 I found it interesting how histograms display data in a way that I am not familiar with, but it a very efficient way to answer questions.
 Something important was that histograms will also be used now.
 When the quiz will be. 
 The most interesting thing was cooperating with my team members to work through assignments. 
 I thought learning to format the histograms on excel was extremely helpful. I can see myself using this tool a lot in the future.
 Histograms and how to use and manipulate them.
 I found the examples of how/when to use each type of chart was quite helpful. Knowing what chart to use when the data was continuous or discrete was particularly interesting 
 I thought the idea of histograms and the flow chart that was presented in class was the most interesting as they both made it easier to distinguish information and what types of graphs to use and when.
 I liked learning about how to format histograms because it was very interesting and will help me gather good information 
 I liked learning about how to change the histograms to make the graph look neater.
 The fact that we were given time and that when we needed help it came. I also like that the graphs are based on experments made close to campus ( the river flow of the river, etc)
 The lost jntetesting part about today was seeing how different a chart can be when we change the numer and size of bins in a historgram
 I liked using the histogram to measure frequency, which occurs often in data.
 How to develop histograms in Excel 2016
 Ways to use histograms to show data.
 I really enjoy spending time with my engineering group. They are really nice and all have the same drive as I do. Spending time is interesting since it makes up for the online class. Thanks!
 Exploring histograms and different graph types helped me understand when to us them. It was interesting  because you can use multiple graph types for data.
 I liked learning more about histograms, and how to read and create them to make data more easy to understand. I feel like this is a very useful skill.
 It was interesting that the data was able to be analyzed with more than 2 sets of data.
 I like to see how the data can compare to itself and other data sets.
 I think that it was important that we talked about the assignments that are due. The most helpful part was when my TA came to our breakout room and talked to us 
 It was interesting to learn about histograms. 
 What was interesting is the concept of in class quizzes,  because I think it is a good method of testing what I know about the subject. Also the engineering events are also interesting.
 I may say the quiz and how to take it.","The class really seemed to find the histograms interesting. They also liked working in breakout rooms and in their groups. The students also seemed to enjoy the time to work on assignments, and found the in-class quizzes helpful.","I liked using the histogram to measure frequency, which occurs often in data.

I found that spider chart that describes what chart we are supposed to use with what data very helpful and interesting
I found the many ways to utilize histograms to use and organize data to be very interesting.
I liked talking with my group during the in class assignment.
What was interesting in class today was being able to do a individual thoughts session with a whole class discussion as well having a break out room discussion.
I enjoyed learning excel. It's a great tool and has a high learning curve which I'm excited to get better at it.
What I found most interesting in today's class was the discussion about histogram. It was interesting to see what different scenarios you would use different graphs for.
Learning how to work better with histograms
It was interesting how there are ways to compare two sets of data with one graph/diagram
The ability to make and format histograms in excel is a great skill to have.
I really liked how we got to spend a lot more time in breakout rooms because we could bounce our ideas off each other!
Being able to identify trends in split data such as (gender)
Learning how to edit histograms was interesting because I have never done it before.
I enjoy the team breakout rooms because it is easier to ask questions.
I have been getting more and more familiar with excel but the lace is still fast enough that I'm falling behind. But with each class including this one I feel better and better using excel.
I thought the different kinds of charts and learning how to edit them was very interesting to me.
When to use the different types of graphs
i liked working with my group
I found learning about histograms to be most interesting.
The inter workings of when to use a histogram because i wondered when we should use it
I liked how we had a lot of time to work on assignment 7. Also the in class assignment was very fun to hear about everyone's different graph types.
The ways that are used to calculate appropriate bin size and number of bins is interesting.
I found it interesting how we began works on an individual project with our group members.
We get to learn about the true meaning behind a histogram
I found taking the applications of statistics into excel interesting. I enjoyed it because I like working with statistics
That you can edit the bins of histogram in excel, I did not previously know that.
I liked the long breakout room time for discussing both our class activitiy and our class assignment we started.
The different charts that are available in excel. Also I didn't know that macs had different versions of excel than other computers.
I think understanding the type of graph to use based on variables was interesting
What I found most interesting was simply how to make histograms out of a dataset.
I found the group time most interesting and the constant review of the due dates. That reminder helps a lot.
I liked figuring out how to correctly format all histograms and included the needed characteristics for each graph.
I found it interesting to get a glimpse of just how many ways we can manipulate and examine specific parts of our data set
Creating  the histograms
I found it interesting how easy it was to organize data into a histogram.
Determining what graphs to use for what situations was quite interesting.
Giving a problem and deciding which chart to use based off the variables
I think using excel is interesting.
I found discussing the different types of graphed and discussing when we should use them most helpful and interesting. I liked that this discussion was interactive.
Excel is such a powerful tool and can evaluate data so quickly.
it was interesting making the histograms, it was difficult finding an underflow bin but i feel like i am getting the hang of excel
The different types of graphs is pretty interesting. They all have different uses and having the flow chart you showed in class is very helpful and interesting.
histograms
The most interesting part of today's class was learning about how to calculate bins and bin width and what the purpose of histograms are.
I found it interesting how much less data you need to create a histogram.
I found histograms and their usefulness interesting. I thought the information you could gather from them was extensive and useful.
I found learning about histograms and how they can show frequency of data to be interesting. I see how useful they can be for data analytics.
The break out rooms were interesting.
I found it interesting how histograms display data in a way that I am not familiar with, but it a very efficient way to answer questions.
Something important was that histograms will also be used now.
When the quiz will be.
The most interesting thing was cooperating with my team members to work through assignments.
I thought learning to format the histograms on excel was extremely helpful. I can see myself using this tool a lot in the future.
Histograms and how to use and manipulate them.
I found the examples of how/when to use each type of chart was quite helpful. Knowing what chart to use when the data was continuous or discrete was particularly interesting
I thought the idea of histograms and the flow chart that was presented in class was the most interesting as they both made it easier to distinguish information and what types of graphs to use and when.
I liked learning about how to format histograms because it was very interesting and will help me gather good information
I liked learning about how to change the histograms to make the graph look neater.
The fact that we were given time and that when we needed help it came. I also like that the graphs are based on experments made close to campus ( the river flow of the river, etc)
The lost jntetesting part about today was seeing how different a chart can be when we change the numer and size of bins in a historgram
I liked using the histogram to measure frequency, which occurs often in data.

I really enjoy spending time with my engineering group. They are really nice and all have the same drive as I do. Spending time is interesting since it makes up for the online class. Thanks!
Exploring histograms and different graph types helped me understand when to us them. It was interesting  because you can use multiple graph types for data.
I liked learning more about histograms, and how to read and create them to make data more easy to understand. I feel like this is a very useful skill.
It was interesting that the data was able to be analyzed with more than 2 sets of data.
I like to see how the data can compare to itself and other data sets.
I think that it was important that we talked about the assignments that are due. The most helpful part was when my TA came to our breakout room and talked to us
It was interesting to learn about histograms.
What was interesting is the concept of in class quizzes,  because I think it is a good method of testing what I know about the subject. Also the engineering events are also interesting.
I may say the quiz and how to take it.","The thing I found most interesting is how and when to use histograms.

 The different types of graphs is pretty interesting. They all have different uses and having the flow chart you showed in class is very helpful and interesting. 
 histograms 
 The most interesting part of today’s class was learning about how to calculate bins and bin width and what the purpose of histograms are.
 I found it interesting how much less data you need to create a histogram.
 I found histograms and their usefulness interesting. I thought the information you could gather from them was extensive and useful.
 I found learning about histograms and how they can show frequency of data to be interesting. I see how useful they can be for data analytics. 
 The break out rooms were interesting. 
 I found it interesting how histograms display data in a way that I am not familiar with, but it a very efficient way to answer questions.
 Something important was that histograms will also be used now.
 When the quiz will be. 
 The most interesting thing was cooperating with my team members to work through assignments. 
 I thought learning to format the histograms on excel was extremely helpful. I can see myself using this tool a lot in the future.
 Histograms and how to use and manipulate them.
 I found the examples of how/when to use each type of chart was quite helpful. Knowing what chart to use when the data was continuous or discrete was particularly interesting 
 I thought the idea of histograms and the flow chart that was presented in class was the most interesting as they both made it easier to distinguish information and what types of graphs to use and when.
 I liked learning about how to format histograms because it was very interesting and will help me gather good information 
 I liked learning about how to change the histograms to make the graph look neater.
 The fact that we were given time and that when we needed help it came. I also like that the graphs are based on experments made close to campus ( the river flow of the river, etc)
 The lost jntetesting part about today was seeing how different a chart can be when we change the numer and size of bins in a historgram
 I liked using the histogram to measure frequency, which occurs often in data.
 How to develop histograms in Excel 2016
 Ways to use histograms to show data.
 I really enjoy spending time with my engineering group. They are really nice and all have the same drive as I do. Spending time is interesting since it makes up for the online class. Thanks!
 Exploring histograms and different graph types helped me understand when to us them. It was interesting  because you can use multiple graph types for data.
 I liked learning more about histograms, and how to read and create them to make data more easy to understand. I feel like this is a very useful skill.
 It was interesting that the data was able to be analyzed with more than 2 sets of data.
 I like to see how the data can compare to itself and other data sets.
 I think that it was important that we talked about the assignments that are due. The most helpful part was when my TA came to our breakout room and talked to us 
 It was interesting to learn about histograms. 
 What was interesting is the concept of in class quizzes,  because I think it is a good method of testing what I know about the subject. Also the engineering events are also interesting.
 I may say the quiz and how to take it.","The class really seemed to find the histograms interesting. They also liked working in breakout rooms and in their groups. The students also seemed to enjoy the time to work on assignments, and found the in-class quizzes helpful.","I liked using the histogram to measure frequency, which occurs often in data.

What I found most interesting in today's class was the discussion about histogram. It was interesting to see what different scenarios you would use different graphs for.
Learning how to work better with histograms
It was interesting how there are ways to compare two sets of data with one graph/diagram
The ability to make and format histograms in excel is a great skill to have.
I really liked how we got to spend a lot more time in breakout rooms because we could bounce our ideas off each other!
Being able to identify trends in split data such as (gender)
Learning how to edit histograms was interesting because I have never done it before.
I enjoy the team breakout rooms because it is easier to ask questions.
I have been getting more and more familiar with excel but the lace is still fast enough that I'm falling behind. But with each class including this one I feel better and better using excel.
I thought the different kinds of charts and learning how to edit them was very interesting to me.
When to use the different types of graphs
i liked working with my group
I found learning about histograms to be most interesting.
The inter workings of when to use a histogram because i wondered when we should use it
I liked how we had a lot of time to work on assignment 7. Also the in class assignment was very fun to hear about everyone's different graph types.
The ways that are used to calculate appropriate bin size and number of bins is interesting.
I found it interesting how we began works on an individual project with our group members.
We get to learn about the true meaning behind a histogram
I found taking the applications of statistics into excel interesting. I enjoyed it because I like working with statistics
That you can edit the bins of histogram in excel, I did not previously know that.
I liked the long breakout room time for discussing both our class activitiy and our class assignment we started.
The different charts that are available in excel. Also I didn't know that macs had different versions of excel than other computers.
I think understanding the type of graph to use based on variables was interesting
What I found most interesting was simply how to make histograms out of a dataset.
I found the group time most interesting and the constant review of the due dates. That reminder helps a lot.
I liked figuring out how to correctly format all histograms and included the needed characteristics for each graph.
I found it interesting to get a glimpse of just how many ways we can manipulate and examine specific parts of our data set
Creating  the histograms
I found it interesting how easy it was to organize data into a histogram.
Determining what graphs to use for what situations was quite interesting.
Giving a problem and deciding which chart to use based off the variables
I think using excel is interesting.
I found discussing the different types of graphed and discussing when we should use them most helpful and interesting. I liked that this discussion was interactive.
Excel is such a powerful tool and can evaluate data so quickly.
it was interesting making the histograms, it was difficult finding an underflow bin but i feel like i am getting the hang of excel
The different types of graphs is pretty interesting. They all have different uses and having the flow chart you showed in class is very helpful and interesting.
histograms
The most interesting part of today's class was learning about how to calculate bins and bin width and what the purpose of histograms are.
I found it interesting how much less data you need to create a histogram.
I found histograms and their usefulness interesting. I thought the information you could gather from them was extensive and useful.
I found learning about histograms and how they can show frequency of data to be interesting. I see how useful they can be for data analytics.
The break out rooms were interesting.
I found it interesting how histograms display data in a way that I am not familiar with, but it a very efficient way to answer questions.
Something important was that histograms will also be used now.
When the quiz will be.
The most interesting thing was cooperating with my team members to work through assignments.
I thought learning to format the histograms on excel was extremely helpful. I can see myself using this tool a lot in the future.
Histograms and how to use and manipulate them.
I found the examples of how/when to use each type of chart was quite helpful. Knowing what chart to use when the data was continuous or discrete was particularly interesting
I thought the idea of histograms and the flow chart that was presented in class was the most interesting as they both made it easier to distinguish information and what types of graphs to use and when.
I liked learning about how to format histograms because it was very interesting and will help me gather good information
I liked learning about how to change the histograms to make the graph look neater.
The fact that we were given time and that when we needed help it came. I also like that the graphs are based on experments made close to campus ( the river flow of the river, etc)
The lost jntetesting part about today was seeing how different a chart can be when we change the numer and size of bins in a historgram
I liked using the histogram to measure frequency, which occurs often in data.

I really enjoy spending time with my engineering group. They are really nice and all have the same drive as I do. Spending time is interesting since it makes up for the online class. Thanks!
Exploring histograms and different graph types helped me understand when to us them. It was interesting  because you can use multiple graph types for data.
I liked learning more about histograms, and how to read and create them to make data more easy to understand. I feel like this is a very useful skill.
It was interesting that the data was able to be analyzed with more than 2 sets of data.
I like to see how the data can compare to itself and other data sets.
I think that it was important that we talked about the assignments that are due. The most helpful part was when my TA came to our breakout room and talked to us
It was interesting to learn about histograms.
What was interesting is the concept of in class quizzes,  because I think it is a good method of testing what I know about the subject. Also the engineering events are also interesting.
I may say the quiz and how to take it.","The thing I found most interesting is how and when to use histograms. 
I'm starting to get the hang of making graphs which is interesting to use.
when to use certain types of graphs to display various data sets (numerical vs nominal, etc.) 
I found that spider chart that describes what chart we are supposed to use with what data very helpful and interesting
I found the many ways to utilize histograms to use and organize data to be very interesting.

The pictures of the dam were amazing and it was interesting to use google scholar -> 4
Working on real projects that are also interesting -> 3
I thought learning about hydropower, the Taum Sauk reservoir, and a whole new project was interesting. -> 4
The reservoir -> 2
the hydro powered generators -> 3
I think learning about the reservoir, and doing some research on the history of the resource and about hydropower generators.  I think the introduction of a new project was very infesting. I also found the intro into how to cite and reference your sources to be very informative. -> 3
How hydropower generators worked -> 5
Learning about hydropower was most interesting. -> 2
I thought the way that HEP works was very interesting -> 4
I liked working with my group today -> 5
I found the modeling aspect of the new assignment interesting. I’m excited to learn more about that and figure the project out. -> 5
I found the complexity of hydroelectricity and the application of it in terms of our assignment to be interesting. -> 3
The new project about the dam. -> 3
I liked how we had group discussions I also liked how we got ahead on an assignment due next week and that we were given more time to work on projects so that we aren’t cramming many at once. -> 5
I’ve never had to use APA before this class, so that will be interesting -> 3
I found the discussion about Taum Sauk and how the hydropower generators work! -> 5
I found the new project we are starting very interesting. The fact that it can hold up to 1.5 billion gallons of water is insane. -> 3
A10 about the Taum Sauk Reservoir seems like it will be more intense than the Bike Share assignments. I believe that as a group, we will improve on the new set of assignments -> 4
Knowing about the articles and reliable sources available from the purdue library, that’s good information to have. -> 4
The whole concept is very interesting, using data and working with a dam is much more interesting than the bike share project -> 4
I liked all the time we got to work on A10 and I also liked how we were able to ask Neel questions if we were confused. It helped tremendously. -> 5
What I found most interesting is the taum Sauk reservoir and the failure that it had -> 3
hydropower is cool. I really like the Hoover dam. its important to note that despite being a renewable source of power, hydropower has one of the largest environmental impacts -> 2
I found the part about hydroelectric power very interesting. It is more interesting than the bike share project in my opinion. -> 3
I found learning about how hydroelectric dams work to be most interesting. It’s nice when you learn a little science on the side. Like a science side salad. With feta cheese. -> 4

Working on real projects that are also interesting -> 3
I thought learning about hydropower, the Taum Sauk reservoir, and a whole new project was interesting. -> 4
The reservoir -> 2
the hydro powered generators -> 3
I think learning about the reservoir, and doing some research on the history of the resource and about hydropower generators.  I think the introduction of a new project was very infesting. I also found the intro into how to cite and reference your sources to be very informative. -> 3

I liked how we had group discussions I also liked how we got ahead on an assignment due next week and that we were given more time to work on projects so that we aren't cramming many at once. -> 5
I've never had to use APA before this class, so that will be interesting -> 3
I found the discussion about Taum Sauk and how the hydropower generators work! -> 5
I found the new project we are starting very interesting. The fact that it can hold up to 1.5 billion gallons of water is insane. -> 3
A10 about the Taum Sauk Reservoir seems like it will be more intense than the Bike Share assignments. I believe that as a group, we will improve on the new set of assignments -> 4
Knowing about the articles and reliable sources available from the purdue library, that's good information to have. -> 4
The whole concept is very interesting, using data and working with a dam is much more interesting than the bike share project -> 4

hydropower is cool. I really like the Hoover dam. its important to note that despite being a renewable source of power, hydropower has one of the largest environmental impacts -> 2
I found the part about hydroelectric power very interesting. It is more interesting than the bike share project in my opinion. -> 3
I found learning about how hydroelectric dams work to be most interesting. It's nice when you learn a little science on the side. Like a science side salad. With feta cheese. -> 4
I found the hydropower generator interesting. I didn't really know how the generator converted mechanical energy into electric until today. -> 4
I thought that the introduction to the project and the data that came with it was interesting. I also liked the in class discussions of how information could be gathered and what questions to ask. -> 3
The idea that the Taum Sauk Reservoir is basically a free standing dam, but that it failed before and causes problems. However, we did not talk much as a group about the concepts behind it. -> 3
I liked how this upcoming project is more straightforward and more of the engineering I'm used to versus just plain data analysis. There is more formulas and things that I find fun. -> 3
I found the google scholar activity interesting. I enjoy doing research and liked getting the practice finding and citing different articles. -> 2
I found it interesting about the different ways you can find a relatable source. It is helpful to know more that one way to do so -> 2

I found the video about how the reservoir works interesting -> 4
Class today went really well. The class discussion was very helpful, with what the company gave us and what we needed to find. I also believe that the work time at the end is very nice to half to get everything organized for our group to work on the project. -> 5
Hydropower is a very interesting concept that was talked about. -> 3
What I found most interesting in today's class was how the whole process of hydropower works and how it creates power. -> 4
i found that the way that hydroelectric power is used is a very unique way. I knew a little about it, but i'm excited for the project that we're doing to learn more about this. Also, i thought the amount of engineers working on dams was very interesting. -> 4
Today I was able to work with my group and we found out that Microsoft does have a sharing system which we heavily took advantage of. I am very happy with our group work and this will give us even better results. -> 4
I enjoyed looking at the statistics and working with my group in class 4a. -> 1
Learning about hydroelectric damns was interesting. This is because its a new and renweable power source with clear tradeoffs -> 4

 Today I was able to work with my group and we found out that Microsoft does have a sharing system which we heavily took advantage of. I am very happy with our group work and this will give us even better results. 
 I found it interesting getting to see how the reservoir works and the applications of it that we will be analyzing. 
 The dam
 What I found most interesting is the taum Sauk reservoir and the failure that it had
 I found the video about how the reservoir works interesting 
 I found learning about how hydroelectric dams work to be most interesting. It's nice when you learn a little science on the side. Like a science side salad. With feta cheese.
 I found the explanation of hydroelectric power interesting and I am excited for this next project we are undertaking.
 the way that hydroelectric plants work was pretty interesting 
 I found it interesting about the different ways you can find a relatable source. It is helpful to know more that one way to do so
 This reservoir is massive! Very interesting to research and I am excited to look into the data and learn more. 
 The whole concept is very interesting, using data and working with a dam is much more interesting than the bike share project
 I found interesting about using google scholar and integrating Purdue data base with it. 
 I think learning about the reservoir, and doing some research on the history of the resource and about hydropower generators.  I think the introduction of a new project was very infesting. I also found the intro into how to cite and reference your sources to be very informative.
 I thought learning about hydropower, the Taum Sauk reservoir, and a whole new project was interesting.
 I found the part about hydroelectric power very interesting. It is more interesting than the bike share project in my opinion.
 I found that learning about how power is generated by flowing water through a turbine was interesting.
 The new project about the dam. 
 How to properly cite your sources.
 The introduction to the new assignment 
 i found that the way that hydroelectric power is used is a very unique way. I knew a little about it, but i'm excited for the project that we're doing to learn more about this. Also, i thought the amount of engineers working on dams was very interesting.
 The most interesting thing was looking into the past history of the Taum Sauk Reservoir. 
 I found the modeling aspect of the new assignment interesting. I'm excited to learn more about that and figure the project out.
 The Taum Sauk reservoir is an upper reservoir that failed and had an accident before.

 A10 about the Taum Sauk Reservoir seems like it will be more intense than the Bike Share assignments. I believe that as a group, we will improve on the new set of assignments 
 It was interesting to learn about the different types of resources we are allowed to use and it was interesting to research the Taum Sauk Reservoir.
 I really like the taum Sauk project we are working on next and I think it will be very interesting because we get to model the system
 Working on real projects that are also interesting
 The pictures of the dam were amazing and it was interesting to use google scholar
 Learning about hydropower was most interesting.
 the hydro powered generators
 I found that learning about the Taum Sauk reservoir was very interesting.
 This class was a little dry, but the introduction to the project helped to clear up some thing that could have been confusing in the future.
 Learning about hydroelectric damns was interesting. This is because its a new and renweable power source with clear tradeoffs
 I found the introduction of our next project very interesting today. Also, I feel like the time spent in breakout rooms during this lecture was much better than previous calls.
 Hydropower is a very interesting concept that was talked about.
 I found that it was important when we talked about information literacy

I found the complexity of hydroelectricity and the application of it in terms of our assignment to be interesting.
Class today went really well. The class discussion was very helpful, with what the company gave us and what we needed to find. I also believe that the work time at the end is very nice to half to get everything organized for our group to work on the project. 
I found the discussion about Taum Sauk and how the hydropower generators work!  
I’ve never had to use APA before this class, so that will be interesting
I liked how this upcoming project is more straightforward and more of the engineering I’m used to versus just plain data analysis. There is more formulas and things that I find fun.
The idea that the Taum Sauk Reservoir is basically a free standing dam, but that it failed before and causes problems. However, we did not talk much as a group about the concepts behind it.
The details of the new project we are beginning
 I liked all the time we got to work on A10 and I also liked how we were able to ask Neel questions if we were confused. It helped tremendously.
 I found learning about generators was interesting. I hope we get to learn more about how electricity is generated in future projects and assignments.
 The reservoir
 I liked working with my group today
 hydropower is cool. I really like the Hoover dam. its important to note that despite being a renewable source of power, hydropower has one of the largest environmental impacts
 I thought that the introduction to the project and the data that came with it was interesting. I also liked the in class discussions of how information could be gathered and what questions to ask.
 Seeing the mechanics of how reservoirs work 
 I liked how we had group discussions I also liked how we got ahead on an assignment due next week and that we were given more time to work on projects so that we aren’t cramming many at once.
 I found the google scholar activity interesting. I enjoy doing research and liked getting the practice finding and citing different articles. 
 I found the new project we are starting very interesting. The fact that it can hold up to 1.5 billion gallons of water is insane.
 I found the hydropower generator interesting. I didn’t really know how the generator converted mechanical energy into electric until today. 
 Knowing about the articles and reliable sources available from the purdue library, that’s good information to have.

Researching about the reservoir was interesting.
I thought learning about the hydroelectric power was interesting
I found the complexity of hydroelectricity and the application of it in terms of our assignment to be interesting.
Class today went really well. The class discussion was very helpful, with what the company gave us and what we needed to find. I also believe that the work time at the end is very nice to half to get everything organized for our group to work on the project. 
I found the discussion about Taum Sauk and how the hydropower generators work!  
I’ve never had to use APA before this class, so that will be interesting
I liked how this upcoming project is more straightforward and more of the engineering I’m used to versus just plain data analysis. There is more formulas and things that I find fun.
The idea that the Taum Sauk Reservoir is basically a free standing dam, but that it failed before and causes problems. However, we did not talk much as a group about the concepts behind it.
The details of the new project we are beginning
 I liked all the time we got to work on A10 and I also liked how we were able to ask Neel questions if we were confused. It helped tremendously.
 I found learning about generators was interesting. I hope we get to learn more about how electricity is generated in future projects and assignments.
 The reservoir
 I liked working with my group today
 hydropower is cool. I really like the Hoover dam. its important to note that despite being a renewable source of power, hydropower has one of the largest environmental impacts
 I thought that the introduction to the project and the data that came with it was interesting. I also liked the in class discussions of how information could be gathered and what questions to ask.
 Seeing the mechanics of how reservoirs work 
 I liked how we had group discussions I also liked how we got ahead on an assignment due next week and that we were given more time to work on projects so that we aren’t cramming many at once.
 I found the google scholar activity interesting. I enjoy doing research and liked getting the practice finding and citing different articles. 
 I found the new project we are starting very interesting. The fact that it can hold up to 1.5 billion gallons of water is insane.
 I found the hydropower generator interesting. I didn’t really know how the generator converted mechanical energy into electric until today. 
 Knowing about the articles and reliable sources available from the purdue library, that’s good information to have. 
 How hydropower generators worked
 I enjoyed learning about hydropower and the company this project is based off of.
 I found the hydropower part interesting as I had previously learned some of this stuff in physics. 
 What I found most interesting in today’s class was how the whole process of hydropower works and how it creates power.
 I enjoyed learning about the Taum Sauk Reservoir and how it works and the failure that happened. 
 Today I was able to work with my group and we found out that Microsoft does have a sharing system which we heavily took advantage of. I am very happy with our group work and this will give us even better results. 
 I found it interesting getting to see how the reservoir works and the applications of it that we will be analyzing. 
 The dam
 What I found most interesting is the taum Sauk reservoir and the failure that it had
 I found the video about how the reservoir works interesting 
 I found learning about how hydroelectric dams work to be most interesting. It’s nice when you learn a little science on the side. Like a science side salad. With feta cheese.
 I found the explanation of hydroelectric power interesting and I am excited for this next project we are undertaking.
 the way that hydroelectric plants work was pretty interesting 
 I found it interesting about the different ways you can find a relatable source. It is helpful to know more that one way to do so
 This reservoir is massive! Very interesting to research and I am excited to look into the data and learn more. 
 The whole concept is very interesting, using data and working with a dam is much more interesting than the bike share project
 I found interesting about using google scholar and integrating Purdue data base with it. 
 I think learning about the reservoir, and doing some research on the history of the resource and about hydropower generators.  I think the introduction of a new project was very infesting. I also found the intro into how to cite and reference your sources to be very informative.
 I thought learning about hydropower, the Taum Sauk reservoir, and a whole new project was interesting.
 I found the part about hydroelectric power very interesting. It is more interesting than the bike share project in my opinion.
 I found that learning about how power is generated by flowing water through a turbine was interesting.
 The new project about the dam. 
 How to properly cite your sources.
 The introduction to the new assignment 
 i found that the way that hydroelectric power is used is a very unique way. I knew a little about it, but i’m excited for the project that we’re doing to learn more about this. Also, i thought the amount of engineers working on dams was very interesting.
 The most interesting thing was looking into the past history of the Taum Sauk Reservoir. 
 I found the modeling aspect of the new assignment interesting. I’m excited to learn more about that and figure the project out.
 The Taum Sauk reservoir is an upper reservoir that failed and had an accident before.

 A10 about the Taum Sauk Reservoir seems like it will be more intense than the Bike Share assignments. I believe that as a group, we will improve on the new set of assignments 
 It was interesting to learn about the different types of resources we are allowed to use and it was interesting to research the Taum Sauk Reservoir.
 I really like the taum Sauk project we are working on next and I think it will be very interesting because we get to model the system
 Working on real projects that are also interesting
 The pictures of the dam were amazing and it was interesting to use google scholar
 Learning about hydropower was most interesting.
 the hydro powered generators
 I found that learning about the Taum Sauk reservoir was very interesting.
 This class was a little dry, but the introduction to the project helped to clear up some thing that could have been confusing in the future.
 Learning about hydroelectric damns was interesting. This is because its a new and renweable power source with clear tradeoffs
 I found the introduction of our next project very interesting today. Also, I feel like the time spent in breakout rooms during this lecture was much better than previous calls.
 Hydropower is a very interesting concept that was talked about.
 I found that it was important when we talked about information literacy 
 I thought the way that HEP works was very interesting",I enjoyed learning about the Taum Sauk Reservoir and how it works and the failure that happened. I really like the taum Sauk project we are working on next and I think it will be very interesting because we get to model the system I found it interesting about the different ways you can find a relatable source.

How to make histograms was confusing. Jeff told our group in the breakout room that we have to base the histogram off of bin width, not bin number. This wasn’t clear in the modules or lecture. -> 4
I feel like i have more questions regarding histograms but since I didnt have enough time to tinker with them in excel i couldnt get to ask them. Should I over prepare for classes? -> 3
The different types of data keep confusing me, especially the difference between the numerical data. -> 3
I thought that the choosing which graph to use part of class was confusing today. I am still confused about nominal vs ordinal and numerical vs categorical. -> 4
The pdf that says what to do for A07 has confusing instructions for what to do with the histograms -> 3
I did not understand how exactly to set the correct bi  width and number in excel for mac. Everytime I place the calculated values, the ranges do not equal whole numbers. -> 3
Nothing was overly confusing besides the conversation about if hourly data points are continuous or discrete. -> 1
Assignment 7 is alittle confusing but I will be reading through it to understand it better. But working with the Excel graph was helpful -> 3
It would be nice if the announcements were on a separate presentation, and reposted on bright space in another tab under content. -> 1
I was confused by the choice of line graph for the in-class assignment. I thought a histogram was the obvious choice as it shows frequency and the question being asked was about low usage, which would be easily identified as a point with low frequency on a histogram. I think the line graph, on the other hand, would have been a better choice if the question was asking about a trend in time, such as: during which intervals of time is the usage increasing? -> 1
Determining what type of data is what, like discrete, nominal, etc. -> 4
I think most of my confusion around histograms was cleared up today but my confusion with excel is still pretty high. For example, I can’t figure out how to order a set of data unless it’s within a pivot table. Also, I’m having trouble making the differences between numerica continuous and numerical discrete data clear. -> 4
Understanding how to specifically format parts of graphs(like the axes) in Excel is confusing. -> 3
One thing that confused me in todays class was how we would go about renaming the document we were supposed to submit for the in class activity. Another thing that confused me was in the in class activity and when we are supposed to submit it. Are we required to submit before exiting the breakout? -> 2
I thought the explanation of how each component of the histograms  are found to be somewhat confusing. -> 2
I am still a little bit unclear on how to work some of the aspects on excel including changing the axis value on a Mac. I would suggest a little bit longer on working through excel. Not necessary, though. -> 2
I would’ve appreciated more time spent on how to adjust the histogram bin range and number of bins to get nice numbers for the axes. -> 4
The process of creating a histogram on Mac. One of my teammate’s struggled with this and I wasn’t sure how to help. -> 3
I did not find anything confusing, and did not need more details in anything. -> 1
I am confused if you find your bin width to have a decimal in it, do you round that up or down to keep the graph nice with no decimals or do you just leave it. -> 4
Today’s lesson was straightforward except the part about histograms and mac users. -> 3
This is separate, but could we receive a little bit more time in the breakout rooms before the PT’s enter the room? A lot of the time we are just reading the instructions and haven’t really gotten into the assignment yet, so we don’t have any questions until after they leave. I am also on Team 07, so I may just be early in the order. Thanks, Kyle -> 3
More instruction on how the Assignment 7 would work. It was very confusing and I don’t have a good grasp from what was told. Everything I tried seems wrong. -> 3
I found that some of the data listed in the in class activity was confusing. They were not distinctly categorized as discrete or nominal, such as time. -> 1
Overall the content today was not confusing I was able to follow along and understand what was happening. -> 1
I thought that everything was fairly easy. The most difficult part is sometimes identifying the type of data being used since some numbers are occasionally still categorical. -> 1
Nothing was really confusing about today’s class. -> 1
The only confusing part about today was determining what the data type was for the time in the in class activity. I thought it was continuous but it ended up being discrete. It was a little confusing to understand at first but I realized once we discussed it as a class. Also figuring out how to use histograms was a bit confusing at first, but I was able to figure that out easily. -> 2
I thought that the discussion on discrete vs continuous data during the part on chart selection confused me a bit. -> 1
I feel like the guidance on how we are supposed to complete and do assignments is minimal, and I feel like we the students don’t have the ability to reach out for help from the instructor or a TA when we are in our small groups. -> 2
I think continuous and discrete data is still confusing so it would be good if you could go over that more in depth with multiple examples. -> 4
I really have a hard time doing the in class activities because I feel like we have very little time and I’m almost never finished by the time I’m called back to the main room. I would appreciate if this time would be longer so that I can finish the activity in time. -> 2
Test -> 3
Everything made sense. -> 1
nothing was really confusing in today's class, everything was pretty straightforward and easy. -> 1
I was confused by how exactly to determine bon intervals on the histograms. -> 3
I could have used some more explanation for how to make histograms on a Mac. -> 3
Whether data is discrete or continuous and which type of graph to use based on this information. I didn’t know a line chart could be used for discrete data, I originally thought that would only apply to continuous. -> 2
When we are setting the bin width do we round up or down? Same with # of bins -> 3
Under flow and over flow -> 4
We definitely needed more time to look at the types of skews associated with histograms. Additionally, it would’ve been nice to look a little closer into the types of data. (Nominal, categorical, ordinal, etc.) -> 3
How to adjust bin / find bin range probably needed more time dedicated to it. It was confusing, I still don’t fully understand how to actually adjust bins and/or find bin range. -> 3
I was confused on to set up a histogram. I didn’t know how to set them up and format them. -> 4
Some of the histogram stuff was fast -> 2
The different types of data almost look subjective to me, so a more in-depth explanation would be nice. -> 2
When to use each visualization method and the different types of data. It’s difficult to find the resources. -> 1
Time as a data type was confusing because it could be discrete in some cases but continuous in others, making it a little vague for defining it. The fact that it doesn’t have a true answer makes it confusing because it makes it difficult to decide what type to classify it as in the future on our personal assignments. -> 4
I feel like we glossed over a lot of the explanations which left ambiguity on creating histograms for me. Also I’m really confused on classifying data as continuous or discrete and nominal or ordinal -> 3
Formating histograms correctly. bin width, number of bins, bin edges. -> 1
I do not understand how we are intended to reconcile bin width, number of bins, and bin borders in A07 without an extremely large underflow. The problem dictates that there must be exactly 18 bins with integer borders, but in part 2 this would require such a large underflow that it distorts the remaining data. -> 4
I found how to adjust bin sizes to fit the data better in excel to be unclear to me. I fiddled with the settings for the histogram in excel but I felt like I was just blindly moving values around. -> 4
The only part of today’s class was being able to identify the type of data. For example, I sometimes have trouble telling whether data is continuous or discrete. Also, it can be difficult to choose what type of chart to use based on what type of data it is. -> 3
Details about which graphs to use when. -> 3
How to know what data representation method to chose given data. Also how to edit histograms within excel. How to calculate bin width and how many bins. Slides were very clean and descriptive. -> 3
A little bit more info about the quiz, like how should we study for it or what to read. Also, I would like feedback on my work to see if I’m doing things well. -> 2
This class was fairly straightforward, nothing was really confusing -> 1
Using the Excel software on Mac was confusing, but Professor Menekse covered it well. The things I was confused about earlier in the class were mostly answered by the end of class. -> 2
The only confusing part was discussing, categorical and numerical data. -> 3
I was confused about the situations when you would use a histogram over a line chart and vice versa as well as situations when both are viable options. -> 3
For A07, I am confused on how we customize the bin widths AND number of bins. After calculating how many bins I need for Table 1, the result is 18. However, when I set the number of bins to 18, the bin width prepopulates to 4.4444 when it should be 5. But, it doesn’t allow me to change it. Thus, I went ahead and made my bin width 5 and my number of bins 16. -> 2
The explanation of the answers of the in-class activity. I had a few questions and we had to keep going back to it -> 3
This class was generally clear and understandable but the task a07 it self was what was confusing to me -> 4
I enjoyed the class it was very informative on the different types of graphs. I think I understand then much more than I did before. -> 2
I was confused as to what slack is and what it is used for -> 2
talking about the in class assignment was slightly confusing with whether time was continuous or discrete -> 1
I think today’s class was good. There was a enough explanation about the EYM and the histogram assignments, as well as the upcoming quiz for Friday. -> 1
what is discrete number and what is numerical -> 3
I would like more clarification on how excel worksheets work for example i was confused on how you got over flow and under flows working and it was confusing for the team causing us to stay confused on how to make the histogram. -> 3
I could not determine what to do if a histogram was a decimal for the bins width and if it were decimal intervals when using the bin number instead. For the histograms, I know how to find each of those values, but when making the graph I don’t know how to alter/change them if the graph still doesn’t look nice. -> 1","A few answers to questions, particularly about discrete vs continuous and numerical vs categorical data types, were difficult to understand. It wouldv’e been nice to hear another perspective or source about these, maybe a GTA or PT’s opinion as well. -> 4
It was a little bit confusing figuring out how to edit the overflow data. Also, this is part of the Modules not the class but I don’t understand why the center of a bin is not just the middle number of that bins range (in the module 31 was not the answer for the range 30-32). -> 4

I was confused by the choice of line graph for the in-class assignment. I thought a histogram was the obvious choice as it shows frequency and the question being asked was about low usage, which would be easily identified as a point with low frequency on a histogram.

I think most of my confusion around histograms was cleared up today but my confusion with excel is still pretty high.

talking about the in class assignment was slightly confusing with whether time was continuous or discrete
I think today’s class was good. There was a enough explanation about the EYM and the histogram assignments, as well as the upcoming quiz for Friday.
what is discrete number and what is numerical
I would like more clarification on how excel worksheets work for example i was confused on how you got over flow and under flows working and it was confusing for the team causing us to stay confused on how to make the histogram.
I could not determine what to do if a histogram was a decimal for the bins width and if it were decimal intervals when using the bin number instead. For the histograms, I know how to find each of those values, but when making the graph I don’t know how to alter/change them if the graph still doesn’t look nice.","A few answers to questions, particularly about discrete vs continuous and numerical vs categorical data types, were difficult to understand. It wouldv’e been nice to hear another perspective or source about these, maybe a GTA or PT’s opinion as well.
It was a little bit confusing figuring out how to edit the overflow data. Also, this is part of the Modules not the class but I don’t understand why the center of a bin is not just the middle number of that bins range (in the module 31 was not the answer for the range 30-32). 
I didn’t understand how to format the histogram axis in excel. Excel automatically adjusts bin width and bin numbers
The part of class that was confusing was how to find bin width. Or more of once you find it do you need to round it up or to the nearest whole number?
It is difficult for mac users to submit assignments and edit in excel so more information on how to do assignments would be helpful.
In today’s class, it was unclear about whether the data in the in class activity was numerical or categorical or ordinal and nominal.
Determining the bin’s upper limit and underflow
The overall clarification for the data types was still somewhat confusing. The person who asked about time brought up a good point.
How to make histograms was confusing. Jeff told our group in the breakout room that we have to base the histogram off of bin width, not bin number. This wasn’t clear in the modules or lecture. 
I feel like i have more questions regarding histograms but since I didnt have enough time to tinker with them in excel i couldnt get to ask them. Should I over prepare for classes?
 The different types of data keep confusing me, especially the difference between the numerical data.
 I thought that the choosing which graph to use part of class was confusing today. I am still confused about nominal vs ordinal and numerical vs categorical.
 The pdf that says what to do for A07 has confusing instructions for what to do with the histograms 
 I did not understand how exactly to set the correct bi  width and number in excel for mac. Everytime I place the calculated values, the ranges do not equal whole numbers.
 Nothing was overly confusing besides the conversation about if hourly data points are continuous or discrete.
 Assignment 7 is alittle confusing but I will be reading through it to understand it better. But working with the Excel graph was helpful 
 It would be nice if the announcements were on a separate presentation, and reposted on bright space in another tab under content. 
 I was confused by the choice of line graph for the in-class assignment. I thought a histogram was the obvious choice as it shows frequency and the question being asked was about low usage, which would be easily identified as a point with low frequency on a histogram. I think the line graph, on the other hand, would have been a better choice if the question was asking about a trend in time, such as: during which intervals of time is the usage increasing?
 Determining what type of data is what, like discrete, nominal, etc.
 I think most of my confusion around histograms was cleared up today but my confusion with excel is still pretty high. For example, I can’t figure out how to order a set of data unless it’s within a pivot table. Also, I’m having trouble making the differences between numerica continuous and numerical discrete data clear.
 Understanding how to specifically format parts of graphs(like the axes) in Excel is confusing. 
 One thing that confused me in todays class was how we would go about renaming the document we were supposed to submit for the in class activity. Another thing that confused me was in the in class activity and when we are supposed to submit it. Are we required to submit before exiting the breakout? 
 I thought the explanation of how each component of the histograms  are found to be somewhat confusing. 
 I am still a little bit unclear on how to work some of the aspects on excel including changing the axis value on a Mac. I would suggest a little bit longer on working through excel. Not necessary, though. 
 I would’ve appreciated more time spent on how to adjust the histogram bin range and number of bins to get nice numbers for the axes.
 The process of creating a histogram on Mac. One of my teammate’s struggled with this and I wasn’t sure how to help.
 I did not find anything confusing, and did not need more details in anything.
 I am confused if you find your bin width to have a decimal in it, do you round that up or down to keep the graph nice with no decimals or do you just leave it. 
 Today’s lesson was straightforward except the part about histograms and mac users. 
 This is separate, but could we receive a little bit more time in the breakout rooms before the PT’s enter the room? A lot of the time we are just reading the instructions and haven’t really gotten into the assignment yet, so we don’t have any questions until after they leave. I am also on Team 07, so I may just be early in the order. Thanks, Kyle
 More instruction on how the Assignment 7 would work. It was very confusing and I don’t have a good grasp from what was told. Everything I tried seems wrong.
 I found that some of the data listed in the in class activity was confusing. They were not distinctly categorized as discrete or nominal, such as time.
 Overall the content today was not confusing I was able to follow along and understand what was happening.
 I thought that everything was fairly easy. The most difficult part is sometimes identifying the type of data being used since some numbers are occasionally still categorical.
 Nothing was really confusing about today’s class.
 The only confusing part about today was determining what the data type was for the time in the in class activity. I thought it was continuous but it ended up being discrete. It was a little confusing to understand at first but I realized once we discussed it as a class. Also figuring out how to use histograms was a bit confusing at first, but I was able to figure that out easily.
 I thought that the discussion on discrete vs continuous data during the part on chart selection confused me a bit.
 I feel like the guidance on how we are supposed to complete and do assignments is minimal, and I feel like we the students don’t have the ability to reach out for help from the instructor or a TA when we are in our small groups. 
 I think continuous and discrete data is still confusing so it would be good if you could go over that more in depth with multiple examples. 
 I really have a hard time doing the in class activities because I feel like we have very little time and I’m almost never finished by the time I’m called back to the main room. I would appreciate if this time would be longer so that I can finish the activity in time. 
 Test
 Everything made sense.
 nothing was really confusing in today's class, everything was pretty straightforward and easy.
 I was confused by how exactly to determine bon intervals on the histograms. 
 I could have used some more explanation for how to make histograms on a Mac.
 Whether data is discrete or continuous and which type of graph to use based on this information. I didn’t know a line chart could be used for discrete data, I originally thought that would only apply to continuous.
 When we are setting the bin width do we round up or down? Same with # of bins
 Under flow and over flow
 We definitely needed more time to look at the types of skews associated with histograms. Additionally, it would’ve been nice to look a little closer into the types of data. (Nominal, categorical, ordinal, etc.)
 How to adjust bin / find bin range probably needed more time dedicated to it. It was confusing, I still don’t fully understand how to actually adjust bins and/or find bin range.
 I was confused on to set up a histogram. I didn’t know how to set them up and format them. 
 Some of the histogram stuff was fast
 The different types of data almost look subjective to me, so a more in-depth explanation would be nice.
 When to use each visualization method and the different types of data. It’s difficult to find the resources.
 Time as a data type was confusing because it could be discrete in some cases but continuous in others, making it a little vague for defining it. The fact that it doesn’t have a true answer makes it confusing because it makes it difficult to decide what type to classify it as in the future on our personal assignments. 
 I feel like we glossed over a lot of the explanations which left ambiguity on creating histograms for me. Also I’m really confused on classifying data as continuous or discrete and nominal or ordinal 
 Formating histograms correctly. bin width, number of bins, bin edges.
 I do not understand how we are intended to reconcile bin width, number of bins, and bin borders in A07 without an extremely large underflow. The problem dictates that there must be exactly 18 bins with integer borders, but in part 2 this would require such a large underflow that it distorts the remaining data.
 I found how to adjust bin sizes to fit the data better in excel to be unclear to me. I fiddled with the settings for the histogram in excel but I felt like I was just blindly moving values around.
 The only part of today’s class was being able to identify the type of data. For example, I sometimes have trouble telling whether data is continuous or discrete. Also, it can be difficult to choose what type of chart to use based on what type of data it is.
 Details about which graphs to use when.
 How to know what data representation method to chose given data. Also how to edit histograms within excel. How to calculate bin width and how many bins. Slides were very clean and descriptive.
 A little bit more info about the quiz, like how should we study for it or what to read. Also, I would like feedback on my work to see if I’m doing things well.
 This class was fairly straightforward, nothing was really confusing
 Using the Excel software on Mac was confusing, but Professor Menekse covered it well. The things I was confused about earlier in the class were mostly answered by the end of class. 
 The only confusing part was discussing, categorical and numerical data. 
 I was confused about the situations when you would use a histogram over a line chart and vice versa as well as situations when both are viable options.
 For A07, I am confused on how we customize the bin widths AND number of bins. After calculating how many bins I need for Table 1, the result is 18. However, when I set the number of bins to 18, the bin width prepopulates to 4.4444 when it should be 5. But, it doesn’t allow me to change it. Thus, I went ahead and made my bin width 5 and my number of bins 16. 
 The explanation of the answers of the in-class activity. I had a few questions and we had to keep going back to it
 This class was generally clear and understandable but the task a07 it self was what was confusing to me 
 I enjoyed the class it was very informative on the different types of graphs. I think I understand then much more than I did before.

For A07, I am confused on how we customize the bin widths AND number of bins. After calculating how many bins I need for Table 1, the result is 18.

This class was fairly straightforward, nothing was really confusing
Using the Excel software on Mac was confusing, but Professor Menekse covered it well. The things I was confused about earlier in the class were mostly answered by the end of class.
The only confusing part was discussing, categorical and numerical data.
I was confused about the situations when you would use a histogram over a line chart and vice versa as well as situations when both are viable options.
For A07, I am confused on how we customize the bin widths AND number of bins. After calculating how many bins I need for Table 1, the result is 18. However, when I set the number of bins to 18, the bin width prepopulates to 4.4444 when it should be 5. But, it doesn't allow me to change it. Thus, I went ahead and made my bin width 5 and my number of bins 16.
The explanation of the answers of the in-class activity. I had a few questions and we had to keep going back to it
This class was generally clear and understandable but the task a07 it self was what was confusing to me
I enjoyed the class it was very informative on the different types of graphs. I think I understand then much more than I did before.
I was confused as to what slack is and what it is used for
talking about the in class assignment was slightly confusing with whether time was continuous or discrete
I think today's class was good. There was a enough explanation about the EYM and the histogram assignments, as well as the upcoming quiz for Friday.
what is discrete number and what is numerical
I would like more clarification on how excel worksheets work for example i was confused on how you got over flow and under flows working and it was confusing for the team causing us to stay confused on how to make the histogram.
I could not determine what to do if a histogram was a decimal for the bins width and if it were decimal intervals when using the bin number instead. For the histograms, I know how to find each of those values, but when making the graph I don't know how to alter/change them if the graph still doesn't look nice.","A few answers to questions, particularly about discrete vs continuous and numerical vs categorical data types, were difficult to understand. It wouldv'e been nice to hear another perspective or source about these, maybe a GTA or PT's opinion as well.
It was a little bit confusing figuring out how to edit the overflow data. Also, this is part of the Modules not the class but I don't understand why the center of a bin is not just the middle number of that bins range (in the module 31 was not the answer for the range 30-32). 
I didn't understand how to format the histogram axis in excel. Excel automatically adjusts bin width and bin numbers
The part of class that was confusing was how to find bin width. Or more of once you find it do you need to round it up or to the nearest whole number?
It is difficult for mac users to submit assignments and edit in excel so more information on how to do assignments would be helpful.
In today's class, it was unclear about whether the data in the in class activity was numerical or categorical or ordinal and nominal.
Determining the bin's upper limit and underflow
The overall clarification for the data types was still somewhat confusing. The person who asked about time brought up a good point.
How to make histograms was confusing. Jeff told our group in the breakout room that we have to base the histogram off of bin width, not bin number. This wasn't clear in the modules or lecture. 
I feel like i have more questions regarding histograms but since I didnt have enough time to tinker with them in excel i couldnt get to ask them. Should I over prepare for classes?
 The different types of data keep confusing me, especially the difference between the numerical data.
 I thought that the choosing which graph to use part of class was confusing today. I am still confused about nominal vs ordinal and numerical vs categorical.
 The pdf that says what to do for A07 has confusing instructions for what to do with the histograms 
 I did not understand how exactly to set the correct bi  width and number in excel for mac. Everytime I place the calculated values, the ranges do not equal whole numbers.
 Nothing was overly confusing besides the conversation about if hourly data points are continuous or discrete.
 Assignment 7 is alittle confusing but I will be reading through it to understand it better. But working with the Excel graph was helpful 
 It would be nice if the announcements were on a separate presentation, and reposted on bright space in another tab under content. 
 I was confused by the choice of line graph for the in-class assignment. I thought a histogram was the obvious choice as it shows frequency and the question being asked was about low usage, which would be easily identified as a point with low frequency on a histogram. I think the line graph, on the other hand, would have been a better choice if the question was asking about a trend in time, such as: during which intervals of time is the usage increasing?
 Determining what type of data is what, like discrete, nominal, etc.
 I think most of my confusion around histograms was cleared up today but my confusion with excel is still pretty high. For example, I can't figure out how to order a set of data unless it's within a pivot table. Also, I'm having trouble making the differences between numerica continuous and numerical discrete data clear.
 Understanding how to specifically format parts of graphs(like the axes) in Excel is confusing. 
 One thing that confused me in todays class was how we would go about renaming the document we were supposed to submit for the in class activity. Another thing that confused me was in the in class activity and when we are supposed to submit it. Are we required to submit before exiting the breakout? 
 I thought the explanation of how each component of the histograms  are found to be somewhat confusing. 
 I am still a little bit unclear on how to work some of the aspects on excel including changing the axis value on a Mac. I would suggest a little bit longer on working through excel. Not necessary, though. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on how to adjust the histogram bin range and number of bins to get nice numbers for the axes.
 The process of creating a histogram on Mac. One of my teammate's struggled with this and I wasn't sure how to help.
 I did not find anything confusing, and did not need more details in anything.
 I am confused if you find your bin width to have a decimal in it, do you round that up or down to keep the graph nice with no decimals or do you just leave it. 
 Today's lesson was straightforward except the part about histograms and mac users. 
 This is separate, but could we receive a little bit more time in the breakout rooms before the PT's enter the room? A lot of the time we are just reading the instructions and haven't really gotten into the assignment yet, so we don't have any questions until after they leave. I am also on Team 07, so I may just be early in the order. Thanks, Kyle
 More instruction on how the Assignment 7 would work. It was very confusing and I don't have a good grasp from what was told. Everything I tried seems wrong.
 I found that some of the data listed in the in class activity was confusing. They were not distinctly categorized as discrete or nominal, such as time.
 Overall the content today was not confusing I was able to follow along and understand what was happening.
 I thought that everything was fairly easy. The most difficult part is sometimes identifying the type of data being used since some numbers are occasionally still categorical.
 Nothing was really confusing about today's class.
 The only confusing part about today was determining what the data type was for the time in the in class activity. I thought it was continuous but it ended up being discrete. It was a little confusing to understand at first but I realized once we discussed it as a class. Also figuring out how to use histograms was a bit confusing at first, but I was able to figure that out easily.
 I thought that the discussion on discrete vs continuous data during the part on chart selection confused me a bit.
 I feel like the guidance on how we are supposed to complete and do assignments is minimal, and I feel like we the students don't have the ability to reach out for help from the instructor or a TA when we are in our small groups. 
 I think continuous and discrete data is still confusing so it would be good if you could go over that more in depth with multiple examples. 
 I really have a hard time doing the in class activities because I feel like we have very little time and I'm almost never finished by the time I'm called back to the main room. I would appreciate if this time would be longer so that I can finish the activity in time.

 Everything made sense.
 nothing was really confusing in today's class, everything was pretty straightforward and easy.
 I was confused by how exactly to determine bon intervals on the histograms. 
 I could have used some more explanation for how to make histograms on a Mac.
 Whether data is discrete or continuous and which type of graph to use based on this information. I didn't know a line chart could be used for discrete data, I originally thought that would only apply to continuous.
 When we are setting the bin width do we round up or down? Same with # of bins
 Under flow and over flow
 We definitely needed more time to look at the types of skews associated with histograms. Additionally, it would've been nice to look a little closer into the types of data. (Nominal, categorical, ordinal, etc.)
 How to adjust bin / find bin range probably needed more time dedicated to it. It was confusing, I still don't fully understand how to actually adjust bins and/or find bin range.
 I was confused on to set up a histogram. I didn't know how to set them up and format them. 
 Some of the histogram stuff was fast
 The different types of data almost look subjective to me, so a more in-depth explanation would be nice.
 When to use each visualization method and the different types of data. It's difficult to find the resources.
 Time as a data type was confusing because it could be discrete in some cases but continuous in others, making it a little vague for defining it. The fact that it doesn't have a true answer makes it confusing because it makes it difficult to decide what type to classify it as in the future on our personal assignments. 
 I feel like we glossed over a lot of the explanations which left ambiguity on creating histograms for me. Also I'm really confused on classifying data as continuous or discrete and nominal or ordinal 
 Formating histograms correctly. bin width, number of bins, bin edges.
 I do not understand how we are intended to reconcile bin width, number of bins, and bin borders in A07 without an extremely large underflow. The problem dictates that there must be exactly 18 bins with integer borders, but in part 2 this would require such a large underflow that it distorts the remaining data.
 I found how to adjust bin sizes to fit the data better in excel to be unclear to me. I fiddled with the settings for the histogram in excel but I felt like I was just blindly moving values around.
 The only part of today's class was being able to identify the type of data. For example, I sometimes have trouble telling whether data is continuous or discrete. Also, it can be difficult to choose what type of chart to use based on what type of data it is.

For the histograms, I know how to find each of those values, but when making the graph I don’t know how to alter/change them if the graph still doesn’t look nice.","The only part of today’s class was being able to identify the type of data. I am still a little bit unclear on how to work some of the aspects on excel including changing the axis value on a Mac. How to know what data representation method to chose given data. For A07, I am confused on how we customize the bin widths AND number of bins.  I feel like the guidance on how we are supposed to complete anddoassignments is minimal, and I feel like we the students don’t havetheability to reach out for help from the instructor or a TA when we areinour small groups.

Using excel learning histograms
The part I found most interesting in today’s class was how well histograms display the distribution of data.
The web chart explaining what charts we can use in excel depending on what information we have been given.
It was interesting in today’s class to learn about how to create histograms in excel and how to format them properly.
Difference between the graphs
The histogram calculations were the most interesting.
I liked going over the graphs more
I liked that we got to work with our groups on the infividual assignments
The usefulness of histograms is great.
i found the histogram and the A07 interesting to figure out
The clarification on what type of graph to make for each type of data
I found interesting the section in which we were shown which chart is best for different data.
I found the way histograms are able to fit data points into bins interesting.
I found it interesting to see how many different graphs would work for a set of data
The flow chart showing which chart to use depending on the type of data being presented.
I found it interesting that time can be both continuous or discrete data depending on the context it is used in. For example, in the bike problem, the time is seen as discrete, as bike usage is recorded at certain hours of the day and cannot be determined for any times in between these.
The helpfulness of histograms and their ability to display data
I think the practice with histograms was really important because it cleared up a lot of my confusion and I feel like I understand it much better now.
I found making histograms to be most interesting.
What i found most interesting in todays class was picking the chart types. I found myself struggling with that in the activities so practicing with graph types and data was helpful and interesting to me.
Histograms and line charts can both be used to show patterns in data where the data are, for example, the total number of bikers during each hour of the day.
I found the graph review most interesting. I liked how many graphs would fit a certain scenario, but ones fit better than others, and this was explained in the lecture today. I also thought it was important that the histograms were reviewed. I also thought it was important that the due dates are posted sometime in the class period, either at the beginning or end.
I enjoyed analyzing the data for the CoGo bike share users to determine periods of low usage. It was interesting to interpret this data.
The things that can be shown with a histogram was very interesting. I found it cool that so many things can be gathered with this simple chart.
Learning about histograms
I really enjoyed learning about histograms and how to implement them and how they organize data.
I enjoyed learning the different ways in which histograms are made. Also the career exploration seems interesting.
There were many different options for making graphs and changing the formatting.
The cool histograms were pretty awesome to see. Looking at the different visualizations is nice.
I found the various uses of histograms to be the most compelling part of today’s class. I had never thought about the various ways you could use histograms.

I found most interesting how to calculate for bins and range.
The most interesting thing about class today was learning about how to use histograms, and when the best times to use a histogram are (like what the best data for a histogram is).
Continued use of Excel has interested me because I never knew just how useful it was with interpreting data.
I found the assignment 07 was the most interesting because it’s helping me understand how to use excel. Excel is tricky for first time users but I’m starting to get the hang of it
I thought the way to create histograms was most interesting because it’s cool to see how data shakes out.
I like how the histograms works and implementing them sounds very useful when analyzing data.
Test
I found the histogram information interesting as they are a type of table I don’t often use.

I found how you can draw certain conclusions from histograms interesting.
The use of histograms as a potential replacement of a line graph in order to represent some data more effectively
Talking about how to create a histogram in excel because excel can be confusing to work with so this was really helpful. I was a little confused on assignment 7 so that was a good overview of what to do.
How much I was able to get done during the class period, we just kept wasting time and I made progress on 3B
The most interesting thing Is probably the guide for mac user, which is extremely helpful
What I found most interesting from this class was how histograms can be used to analyze data.
The introduction to histograms and how to use them was pretty interesting. It will be a helpful tool in the future.

I enjoyed the studio time working with my group on our assignments. We got a lot done. 
I really like statistics so I love learning about data distribution and skew and what changes how a group of data presents itself. 
Using excel learning histograms
The part I found most interesting in today’s class was how well histograms display the distribution of data. 
The web chart explaining what charts we can use in excel depending on what information we have been given.
It was interesting in today’s class to learn about how to create histograms in excel and how to format them properly.
Difference between the graphs 
The histogram calculations were the most interesting.
I liked going over the graphs more
I liked that we got to work with our groups on the infividual assignments
 The usefulness of histograms is great.
 i found the histogram and the A07 interesting to figure out
 The clarification on what type of graph to make for each type of data
 I found interesting the section in which we were shown which chart is best for different data.
 I found the way histograms are able to fit data points into bins interesting.
 I found it interesting to see how many different graphs would work for a set of data
 The flow chart showing which chart to use depending on the type of data being presented. 
 I found it interesting that time can be both continuous or discrete data depending on the context it is used in. For example, in the bike problem, the time is seen as discrete, as bike usage is recorded at certain hours of the day and cannot be determined for any times in between these. 
 The helpfulness of histograms and their ability to display data
 I think the practice with histograms was really important because it cleared up a lot of my confusion and I feel like I understand it much better now.
 I found making histograms to be most interesting. 
 What i found most interesting in todays class was picking the chart types. I found myself struggling with that in the activities so practicing with graph types and data was helpful and interesting to me.
 Histograms and line charts can both be used to show patterns in data where the data are, for example, the total number of bikers during each hour of the day. 
 I found the graph review most interesting. I liked how many graphs would fit a certain scenario, but ones fit better than others, and this was explained in the lecture today. I also thought it was important that the histograms were reviewed. I also thought it was important that the due dates are posted sometime in the class period, either at the beginning or end. 
 I enjoyed analyzing the data for the CoGo bike share users to determine periods of low usage. It was interesting to interpret this data.
 The things that can be shown with a histogram was very interesting. I found it cool that so many things can be gathered with this simple chart.
 Learning about histograms
 I really enjoyed learning about histograms and how to implement them and how they organize data. 
 I enjoyed learning the different ways in which histograms are made. Also the career exploration seems interesting.
 There were many different options for making graphs and changing the formatting.
 The cool histograms were pretty awesome to see. Looking at the different visualizations is nice.
 I found the various uses of histograms to be the most compelling part of today’s class. I had never thought about the various ways you could use histograms.
 The histogram plotting and the activity A07
 I thought working thought making histograms was very useful. Online classes can make this type of learning hard through videos but walkthroughs are much more beneficial.
 I found most interesting how to calculate for bins and range. 
 The most interesting thing about class today was learning about how to use histograms, and when the best times to use a histogram are (like what the best data for a histogram is).
 Continued use of Excel has interested me because I never knew just how useful it was with interpreting data.
 I found the assignment 07 was the most interesting because it’s helping me understand how to use excel. Excel is tricky for first time users but I’m starting to get the hang of it
 I thought the way to create histograms was most interesting because it’s cool to see how data shakes out. 
 I like how the histograms works and implementing them sounds very useful when analyzing data.
 I found the histogram information interesting as they are a type of table I don’t often use.
 Creating histograms and modifying them to make them more useful
 I found how you can draw certain conclusions from histograms interesting. 
 The use of histograms as a potential replacement of a line graph in order to represent some data more effectively 
 Talking about how to create a histogram in excel because excel can be confusing to work with so this was really helpful. I was a little confused on assignment 7 so that was a good overview of what to do.
 How much I was able to get done during the class period, we just kept wasting time and I made progress on 3B
 The most interesting thing Is probably the guide for mac user, which is extremely helpful 
 What I found most interesting from this class was how histograms can be used to analyze data.
 The introduction to histograms and how to use them was pretty interesting. It will be a helpful tool in the future. 
 I found the used of different graphs and what situations were best to uses what graphs interesting. 
 I found it interesting learning how to represent different data with different charts
 Learning more about my breakout group
 The use of excel to create histograms and other charts.
 The most interesting part of class was learning another type of visual representation of data through the histogram. 
 The most interesting thing I got from today’s class were the chart type flow charts and getting the general outline of the quiz
 using different graphs for different data sets
 Learning to use various charts in different contexts.
 I enjoyed learning about how to make histograms in excel for the most part, excluding the bit that lacked explanation that I mentioned earlier
 I found the histograms the most interesting today. Earlier in the A03 assignment I was having trouble figuring out how charts worked and making intervals, so learning about bins was really helpful.
 The information about which plots are best used for which questions.
 Learning how to make histograms one excel. Working in breakout rooms.
 I like the part where we can engage with class. More of that would be nice as well as the polls you did before.
 I liked that we were starting to get a bit more into statistics and excel, both are used heavily in chemical engineering
 I found the idea that Excell can process so much data and give relevant graphics out of it interesting today. 
 I found it interesting how to use a histogram 
 I enjoyed working with the in-class activity for today because it helped me understand the creation of graphs in Microsoft Excell.
 I am really enjoying group work and I find it very easy to communicate and engage with my team. We help each other whenever something is confusing and I’m happy that I got grouped with them!
 how histograms could be applied to summarize data sets and their associated distributions.
 Today we got to review histograms and check in with our group members about our project. The new project seems exciting and fun to do
 The in class activity 
 I found that the group time was very helpful because I learned how to make histograms on excel and change the boxes
 histograms. 
 I think the review of graphs was very interesting as it helped clarify the differences between them. I definitely used the wrong graphs for the previous assignments due today, but this class helped clarify the differences. 
 How to create a histogram. 
 I liked learning about finding out how to graph different variables. I also found how the histograms and the use of the statistics function useful. 
 What I found most interesting in today’s class was the implementation of examples to give students a more broad demonstration of histograms. I found it interesting how changing the type of data could completely change whether or not a certain graph was the better choice to use.",I think the review of graphs was very interesting as it helped clarify the differences between them.

 The helpfulness of histograms and their ability to display data
 I think the practice with histograms was really important because it cleared up a lot of my confusion and I feel like I understand it much better now.
 I found making histograms to be most interesting. 
 What i found most interesting in todays class was picking the chart types. I found myself struggling with that in the activities so practicing with graph types and data was helpful and interesting to me.
 Histograms and line charts can both be used to show patterns in data where the data are, for example, the total number of bikers during each hour of the day. 
 I found the graph review most interesting. I liked how many graphs would fit a certain scenario, but ones fit better than others, and this was explained in the lecture today. I also thought it was important that the histograms were reviewed. I also thought it was important that the due dates are posted sometime in the class period, either at the beginning or end. 
 I enjoyed analyzing the data for the CoGo bike share users to determine periods of low usage. It was interesting to interpret this data.

 Test
 I found the histogram information interesting as they are a type of table I don’t often use.
 Creating histograms and modifying them to make them more useful
 I found how you can draw certain conclusions from histograms interesting. 
 The use of histograms as a potential replacement of a line graph in order to represent some data more effectively 
 Talking about how to create a histogram in excel because excel can be confusing to work with so this was really helpful. I was a little confused on assignment 7 so that was a good overview of what to do.
 How much I was able to get done during the class period, we just kept wasting time and I made progress on 3B
 The most interesting thing Is probably the guide for mac user, which is extremely helpful 
 What I found most interesting from this class was how histograms can be used to analyze data.
 The introduction to histograms and how to use them was pretty interesting. It will be a helpful tool in the future. 
 I found the used of different graphs and what situations were best to uses what graphs interesting. 
 I found it interesting learning how to represent different data with different charts
 Learning more about my breakout group
 The use of excel to create histograms and other charts.
 The most interesting part of class was learning another type of visual representation of data through the histogram. 
 The most interesting thing I got from today’s class were the chart type flow charts and getting the general outline of the quiz
 using different graphs for different data sets
 Learning to use various charts in different contexts.
 I enjoyed learning about how to make histograms in excel for the most part, excluding the bit that lacked explanation that I mentioned earlier
 I found the histograms the most interesting today. Earlier in the A03 assignment I was having trouble figuring out how charts worked and making intervals, so learning about bins was really helpful.
 The information about which plots are best used for which questions.
 Learning how to make histograms one excel. Working in breakout rooms.
 I like the part where we can engage with class. More of that would be nice as well as the polls you did before.
 I liked that we were starting to get a bit more into statistics and excel, both are used heavily in chemical engineering
 I found the idea that Excell can process so much data and give relevant graphics out of it interesting today. 
 I found it interesting how to use a histogram 
 I enjoyed working with the in-class activity for today because it helped me understand the creation of graphs in Microsoft Excell.
 I am really enjoying group work and I find it very easy to communicate and engage with my team. We help each other whenever something is confusing and I’m happy that I got grouped with them!
 how histograms could be applied to summarize data sets and their associated distributions.
 Today we got to review histograms and check in with our group members about our project. The new project seems exciting and fun to do
 The in class activity 
 I found that the group time was very helpful because I learned how to make histograms on excel and change the boxes
 histograms. 
 I think the review of graphs was very interesting as it helped clarify the differences between them. I definitely used the wrong graphs for the previous assignments due today, but this class helped clarify the differences. 
 How to create a histogram. 
 I liked learning about finding out how to graph different variables. I also found how the histograms and the use of the statistics function useful. 
 What I found most interesting in today’s class was the implementation of examples to give students a more broad demonstration of histograms. I found it interesting how changing the type of data could completely change whether or not a certain graph was the better choice to use.","In today's lecture, students were most interested in histograms, including how to make and utilize them and some of their general properties. Students also enjoyed learning about what charts to use to represent different variables and data types the best. Additionally, students liked working with their groups and interacting with the class in general. Furthermore, students found the in-class activity (assignment 7) very helpful. Finally, students felt that they were getting better at using Excel, and class helped clarify some of their problems.",I really enjoyed learning about histograms and how to implement them and how they organize data.

The most interesting thing I got from today's class were the chart type flow charts and getting the general outline of the quiz
using different graphs for different data sets
Learning to use various charts in different contexts.
I enjoyed learning about how to make histograms in excel for the most part, excluding the bit that lacked explanation that I mentioned earlier
I found the histograms the most interesting today. Earlier in the A03 assignment I was having trouble figuring out how charts worked and making intervals, so learning about bins was really helpful.
The information about which plots are best used for which questions.
Learning how to make histograms one excel. Working in breakout rooms.
I like the part where we can engage with class. More of that would be nice as well as the polls you did before.
I liked that we were starting to get a bit more into statistics and excel, both are used heavily in chemical engineering
I found the idea that Excell can process so much data and give relevant graphics out of it interesting today.

I enjoyed working on the team project and getting a chance to work ahead with my group. -> 3", ,,"I enjoyed working with my team in studio time today to work on assignment 10.
I really like statistics and I enjoyed using my calculator to input data and create formulas to represent data. I also did some research on the Taum Sauk reservoir which was fun.
What I found interesting about today’s class was how there are so many different models to depict a system. 
I found it interesting that Reservoirs can be so complex. And that so many different types of engineers are needed in order to create such a reservoir.
I thought the laminar approach to modeling was interesting as I had never heard of it before and it made a lot of sense to me.
I found the different ways that values can be approximated to be a cool challenge.
Modeling 
Going over simple examples of how to use the laminar approach 
I was making charts about the different relationships between volumes of the upper lower and total reservoirs and found their relationships interesting
It was interesting to see the way mathematical models can be used to represent many things.
 I found it interesting how we would need to use the vertical cross section in order to determine the change in the horizontal cross section.
 I found it interesting how we could fins the distance between the resvoirs 
 The ability to model anything mathematically 
 I found that calculating volume of complex shapes can be do e using the laminar method and a depth of 1 ft. 
 I found it very interesting that you are able to find an equation for perimeter that applies for both shapes without having to adjust for each.
 Once I can fully understand the concept of outlet models I will find it more interesting
 The in-class activity was really important I thought because it was a good “stepping stone” into project 2 and assignment a10.
 I found the part of the lecture where you explained Part 4 to be interesting because I started to understand it better
 Though everything was already covered by the modules that were required to be completed prior to class, I found it intriguing how the different models show different information and in different ways. 
 I found the part where we were applying the power equation and information to the Taum Sauk project with our group interesting
 I enjoyed learning about modeling. It’s fun to try and predict and create equations for different circumstances.
 I found the way to create mathematical models from large data sets very interesting. Creating these mathematical models will be fun for me. 
 Its reallly hard to approximate taum sauks volume
 The taum sauk reservoir calculations were interesting because seeing how simple the calculation for power is is very cool.
 I really liked learning how we solve for P and how to represent something mathematically. 
 The class in all was very interesting
 Excel can be used to create this relationship between volume and water height in the reservoir. I also didn’t realize at first that you have to adjust your volume formula based on the slope when u go deeper. I was assuming that it was just a straight vertical line to the bottom.
 It was interesting that I can get estimate value of a stuff in real life with mathematical way.
 This class didn’t interest me too much. Just learning nee stuff seemed cool and was good to get in.
 I found nothing interesting in class. Being Friday, I was very exhausted and uninterested. However, I will study the topics from class later tonight to get a better understanding of the material.
 I thought that coming up with a model for the reservoir was interesting and provided an enjoyable challenge, because it requires some creative thinking.
 I found interesting the layering methods we are using because level curves seems to be more accurate.
 When we learned about the laminar approach, that was the most interesting to me. 
 I thought it was great when we were working with our team members. It really helped me understand better. 
 The most interesting part of today’s class was investigating for the assignment 10 project and learn more about hydroelectric power.
 I found the Pressure head calculation applications interesting
 getting the volume for the reservoir
 I found the additional research on the project my team did today very interesting. 
 I found it interesting that engineers use units like feet-acres which seem very unusual at a first glance, but actually have a really useful meaning in the real world. 
 The laminar approach for estimating volume
 I found the laminar approach to be the most confusing and the most interesting part of the lecture today. It’s like a three dimensional application of Riemann sums.
 How use it is to develop an equation to solve for/simply complex data or problems
 I found the formula for the power of the reservoir interesting.
 The most interesting thing in today’s class was learning about the drop in altitude between the two reservoirs because I thought it was interesting that the gap was so large. 
 I really enjoy the progression to more group time 
 leaning how to model the perimeter of geometric shapes.
 I found calculating the pressure head interesting because I had trouble doing that in high school and now it is a little more familiar, so it was fun to practice that again.
 The information about modeling.
 It was very interesting to start brainstorming ideas and shapes for our models.
 I enjoyed the in class activity, it was different to what we have been doing in the last few classes 
 I really like this project idea. I've modeled a coal-fired generator as a rankine cycle before in my thermodynamics class, and this project seems to be really similar. 
 The size of the reservoir and how it was best used. 
 It was very interesting how to calculate the power of the reservoirs 
 I found the modeling of the reservoir volume interesting since it required me to use some of my skills learned from calculus and other math classes to solve.
 Today’s class was great and I ended up getting a lot of work done with my team! I enjoyed the in class activity and learned a lot about the Taum Sauk reservoir. The presentation was very clear and the TAs were helpful. 
 how useful laminar models can be 
 we were able to work together again in breakout rooms and so that was good interaction 
 I really like this project, i find the concept of us working on a real world problem excites me because it helps give incite into what our future is going to look like
 The group time was plenty of time for my group to be efficient and work on assignment 10
 creating models for a situation 
 What was most interesting was learning about the laminar model and how it differs from others. 
 building a mathematical model to solve questions. 
 The thing I found most important in today’s class is that the mathematical model doesn’t have to be specific to one answer and is based on the preference of the person making it. However, such preferences can alter the accuracy of the calculations made based on the model.","Overall, it seems that the Tom Sauk Reservoir example really resonated with the students. The class seemed to be focused on introducing mathematical modeling, and using calculations to estimate certain real-world concepts. Students also seemed to appreciate the time that was relegated to working in the group, and on Assignment 10.",I found the way to create mathematical models from large data sets very interesting. Creating these mathematical models will be fun for me. The taum sauk reservoir calculations were interesting because seeing how simple the calculation for power is is very cool. The most interesting part of today’s class was investigating for the assignment 10 project and learn more about hydroelectric power.

nothing that interesting. -> 1.0
That reservoir is cool. I would like to learn more about it snd how it creates energy -> 2.0
I enjoyed working on the team project and getting a chance to work ahead with my group. -> 3.0",,"I enjoyed working with my team in studio time today to work on assignment 10.
I really like statistics and I enjoyed using my calculator to input data and create formulas to represent data. I also did some research on the Taum Sauk reservoir which was fun.
What I found interesting about today's class was how there are so many different models to depict a system. 
I found it interesting that Reservoirs can be so complex. And that so many different types of engineers are needed in order to create such a reservoir.
I thought the laminar approach to modeling was interesting as I had never heard of it before and it made a lot of sense to me.
I found the different ways that values can be approximated to be a cool challenge.
Modeling 
Going over simple examples of how to use the laminar approach 
I was making charts about the different relationships between volumes of the upper lower and total reservoirs and found their relationships interesting
It was interesting to see the way mathematical models can be used to represent many things.
 I found it interesting how we would need to use the vertical cross section in order to determine the change in the horizontal cross section.
 I found it interesting how we could fins the distance between the resvoirs 
 The ability to model anything mathematically 
 I found that calculating volume of complex shapes can be do e using the laminar method and a depth of 1 ft. 
 I found it very interesting that you are able to find an equation for perimeter that applies for both shapes without having to adjust for each.
 Once I can fully understand the concept of outlet models I will find it more interesting
 The in-class activity was really important I thought because it was a good “stepping stone” into project 2 and assignment a10.
 I found the part of the lecture where you explained Part 4 to be interesting because I started to understand it better
 Though everything was already covered by the modules that were required to be completed prior to class, I found it intriguing how the different models show different information and in different ways. 
 I found the part where we were applying the power equation and information to the Taum Sauk project with our group interesting
 I enjoyed learning about modeling. It's fun to try and predict and create equations for different circumstances.
 I found the way to create mathematical models from large data sets very interesting. Creating these mathematical models will be fun for me. 
 Its reallly hard to approximate taum sauks volume
 The taum sauk reservoir calculations were interesting because seeing how simple the calculation for power is is very cool.
 I really liked learning how we solve for P and how to represent something mathematically. 
 The class in all was very interesting
 Excel can be used to create this relationship between volume and water height in the reservoir. I also didn't realize at first that you have to adjust your volume formula based on the slope when u go deeper. I was assuming that it was just a straight vertical line to the bottom.
 It was interesting that I can get estimate value of a stuff in real life with mathematical way.
 This class didn't interest me too much. Just learning nee stuff seemed cool and was good to get in.
 I found nothing interesting in class. Being Friday, I was very exhausted and uninterested. However, I will study the topics from class later tonight to get a better understanding of the material.
 I thought that coming up with a model for the reservoir was interesting and provided an enjoyable challenge, because it requires some creative thinking.
 I found interesting the layering methods we are using because level curves seems to be more accurate.
 When we learned about the laminar approach, that was the most interesting to me. 
 I thought it was great when we were working with our team members. It really helped me understand better. 
 The most interesting part of today's class was investigating for the assignment 10 project and learn more about hydroelectric power.
 I found the Pressure head calculation applications interesting
 getting the volume for the reservoir
 I found the additional research on the project my team did today very interesting. 
 I found it interesting that engineers use units like feet-acres which seem very unusual at a first glance, but actually have a really useful meaning in the real world. 
 The laminar approach for estimating volume
 I found the laminar approach to be the most confusing and the most interesting part of the lecture today. It's like a three dimensional application of Riemann sums.
 How use it is to develop an equation to solve for/simply complex data or problems
 I found the formula for the power of the reservoir interesting.
 The most interesting thing in today's class was learning about the drop in altitude between the two reservoirs because I thought it was interesting that the gap was so large. 
 I really enjoy the progression to more group time 
 leaning how to model the perimeter of geometric shapes.
 I found calculating the pressure head interesting because I had trouble doing that in high school and now it is a little more familiar, so it was fun to practice that again.
 The information about modeling.
 It was very interesting to start brainstorming ideas and shapes for our models.
 I enjoyed the in class activity, it was different to what we have been doing in the last few classes 
 I really like this project idea. I've modeled a coal-fired generator as a rankine cycle before in my thermodynamics class, and this project seems to be really similar. 
 The size of the reservoir and how it was best used. 
 It was very interesting how to calculate the power of the reservoirs 
 I found the modeling of the reservoir volume interesting since it required me to use some of my skills learned from calculus and other math classes to solve.
 Today's class was great and I ended up getting a lot of work done with my team! I enjoyed the in class activity and learned a lot about the Taum Sauk reservoir. The presentation was very clear and the TAs were helpful. 
 how useful laminar models can be 
 we were able to work together again in breakout rooms and so that was good interaction 
 I really like this project, i find the concept of us working on a real world problem excites me because it helps give incite into what our future is going to look like
 The group time was plenty of time for my group to be efficient and work on assignment 10
 creating models for a situation 
 What was most interesting was learning about the laminar model and how it differs from others. 
 building a mathematical model to solve questions. 
 The thing I found most important in today's class is that the mathematical model doesn't have to be specific to one answer and is based on the preference of the person making it. However, such preferences can alter the accuracy of the calculations made based on the model.","Overall, it seems that the Tom Sauk Reservoir example really resonated with the students. The class seemed to be focused on introducing mathematical modeling, and using calculations to estimate certain real-world concepts. Students also seemed to appreciate the time that was relegated to working in the group, and on Assignment 10.",I thought that the mathematical modeling with perimeters Of shapes was interesting and fun  |_| I found that spending more time with our break out groups was helpful for working through any confusion |_| Finding the volume for the reservoir was interesting because we are applying our math knowledge to a real life situation |_| It was fun and interesting using google earth to map the surface area of the reservoir. |_| The time to work on A10 was helpful,"Models or Modeling

Example problems
I enjoyed the fact that we kept going into breakout rooms in small intervals. It helped us bounce ideas off each other.
I found the integrals interesting because it matches up with what I am doing in math class right now. 
The checking as a point charge and line charge
i found that the different charge densities were  interesting 
 I found the fact that we can use integrals to solve these problems very interesting. It is a very practical application of calculus. 
 I found it interesting how calculus integrates into physics. It was cool to see how the integral can be used to calculate an electric field. 
 I found most interesting how we can use integration to determine the electric field
 Compared to the ring of charge, the line of charge is pretty simple and easy to understand
 The mathematical formulas that define abstract electrical concepts are really interesting.
 I found it interesting how an integral can be used to calculate any shape of forces. 
 I love math especially calculus so to see any type is always refreshing. I always enjoy seeing when both are involved in each other (I’m learning some physics in calc 3 right now too)
 I found it very interesting that integrals can be related to electric fields.
 I thought it was interesting to see the different forms of dq over multiple dimensions.
 The electric field diagrams were easy to learn and interesting.
 I like when we do problems together in class as it gives us an example on how we should start the top hat questions when we have to do them individually. 
 I found the charge distribution problems most interesting today. I found it interesting because it can go the way you think, but also a different way if there are different factors. 
 Definitely the electric field demonstrations we watched on youtube. It was really cool to see actual electric fields","I found most interesting how we can use integration to determine the electric field How the Calculus concepts were applied to extended charges (integrals, u-substitution) The electric field diagrams were easy to learn and interesting.
