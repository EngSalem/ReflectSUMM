0,63,63,Alex,engr131_s014-fall2020,5,Describe what was confusing or needed more details in today's class?,"I didn’t find anything confusing during class. I felt that the presentation and class overall moved at consistent and helpful speed and everything was related in a non-confusing manner. -> 1
It was confusing that we were reviewing what types of graphs were correct for a situation when we had already submitted an assignment with our choices of what graphs we thought best displayed data. -> 3
It was confusing that we had done an assignment on what graph we should use for data analysis but we were taught it today in class. -> 2
I was confused by all the due dates and the way the bright space is set up. I forgot to do assignment A06 because it wasn’t in the “To Do before class” category for class 4A -> 3
It’s a little confusing on knowing which graph or chart to use or if you can use more than one. -> 2
More in depth about how to make more complicated histograms -> 2
Some parts of the in class activity were confusing but it was mainly excel stuff -> 5
The lecture didn’t confuse me at all, but when we started assignment A07, I couldn’t figure out how to correctly change the bin widths. -> 3
i didn’t understand that the histograms didn’t need the date so i spent the whole break out room confused. I also think the breakout rooms should’ve been longer. -> 4
I did not know what value the histogram needed to be edited at. -> 3
Nothing was confusing -> 1
I was confused about how the in class quiz will work and what it is over. -> 1
Nothing needed more explanation in today’s class. I found everything to be very clear. However, I would have liked to know what kind of chart should have been submitted for the in class activity. -> 1
Nothing much. I think I just need to get more comfortable using histograms and understanding how to set them up using excel. -> 2
I feel like everything seemed to be pretty straight forward today! I was not confused about anything today! I felt that we really went over histograms well and it seemed to make sense to me! -> 1
Do i have to use a underflow on my histogram or is it just recommended? -> 2
I think sometimes we are unable to follow the slide or the instruction was not clear enough, so I wish professor could go into detail when performing excel stuff -> 3
Nothing -> 1
Initially I was a little confused on how to manipulate certain data within the graphs using the tables but eventually I got it sorted out -> 1
I had issues using excel with my Mac, couldn’t find the bins option when making a histogram. I’ve been having similar problems while doing other assignments. -> 4
I’m just having a lot of trouble with excel, and I’m unable to complete many of the assignments due to this. But I’ll figure it out. -> 4
I’m confused on how to find overflow/underflow values. -> 4
I feel as though the theory of histograms was explained well but the implementation of them in excel was a little lacking. -> 3
I was confused for a while because I have a Mac and could not figure out how to change the bin data. I figured out that u can change it by clicking on the value bar itself. It was helpful at the end that professor explained how to add the add on. I wish we were able to reference the slides while in breakout rooms. -> 1
The most confusing part of today’s lesson was trying to determine wether to use a line chart or a histogram. -> 2
Nothing! I feel like I understood it all today and it made sense! -> 1
There is not much things that are confusing or unclear. I understand what we are gonna do and prepare for next class, and the definition and use about histogram is clear enough for me -> 1
I believe class today was very informative. There were definitely some question about histograms that I had answered. -> 1
Everything was pretty clear today. The histograms we worked on were pretty self explanatory -> 1
I am still a little confused on when the career exploration modules/quizzes are due compared to the EYM zoom meetings and attendances. -> 1
I found everything pretty straightforward. I wish we saw the slide you were talking about that had al the due dates so we didn’t have to find it later, but other than that it was good -> 2
A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful. -> 1
I didn’t think anything was confusing even thought I was having computer troubles where I couldn’t heard anything though zoom. Other than that the histograms where explained very well. -> 1
I found some of the histogram making to be somewhat confusing mainly because I was on mac and did not know that I needed to add a tool kit to change the bins and basically the characteristics of the entire graph. -> 2
I think that maybe there could be more information on when you use histograms. I know it’s for distribution but still a little confused on when you use them all. -> 2
There were parts of the directions for A07 that were unclear, like the part about calculating bin widths and using underflow bins. -> 3
Did the homework assignment need a under flow or over flow bin? -> 1
The in class activity gave my group some confusion because it was not explained in detail, and when breakout rooms opened, we did not understand the entire assignment. -> 3
For the in class activity, it was confusing because nobody in my group had a picture of the slides and we didnt have a way to get to them, so we werent sure on what exactly we needed to do. -> 1
As I also submitted last class, I would like the option of making questions in the class during the presentation. The thing is that the Raise Hand buttton does not show much, as some peers forget it On. I would like another button, such as the tick, to mean I have a question. Thanks. -> 2
Initially, I was confusing about when exactly the A03 was due, but this was cleared up part way through the lecture. I am however still wondering if I need to e-mail the professor if I turned it in 2 minutes late today from the confusion. This seemed to be an issue across the board. -> 4
nothing was confusing except the bins for the histogram -> 2
I felt comfortable today. -> 1
The specific usage of histograms and how to format them correctly what a little confusing. Also how to sign up for the engineering school videos was still confusing. -> 3
I think everything was clear in today’s class. I’m starting to get the hang of it which is good so I can get in a routine. -> 1
Everything was pretty simple in today’s class. I didn’t really have any questions that I could not answer by reviewing the video and the slides. I am still a little confused on the EYM events. -> 1
I had a hard time creating the bins in excel for assignment 7. Everything else was pretty very clear! -> 4
I was a little confused about what graph to use in the in class activity at first. Since a histogram in my mind would also be able to be used -> 2
Everything was clearly explained. The only confusion was with the assignments we were working on. -> 1
What was most confusing in class today was adjusting the bin width by creating an under flow value because I would have to create a large value to make the bin width an integer and I was not sure if I was doing the correctly. -> 3
Not much was confusing. I understood all the concepts but the only real confusing part was figuring out how to navigate excel correctly. -> 2
Could you send out an email or something to help us keep up with assignments? Also are the before class assignments taken as a grade? -> 3
The instructions for the in class assignment wasn’t posted in the chat until near the end of the breakout room. This made the assignment difficult to complete. -> 3
I am confused on A05. We were not told how to process that much data on excel. I am not sure about how to complete this team assignment because I dont know how to divide this up and complete the assignment -> 4
how to change the bin size from the assigned bins in excel -> 3
I wish that it was easier to see the questions or prompts when we break off into our individual groups because I had trouble working on the in class activity because I didn’t know the prompt -> 1
Great, productive class today. Going a bit slower on the notes would have been nice so I could write the notes. -> 1
There was nothing confusing in the class today for me. I thought everything was explained very well. -> 1
I am still confused on how to identify Underflow Bins. -> 4
I found nothing confusing today, everything made sense to me. -> 1
The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped. -> 3
I still am unsure about the differences between categorical and nominal data. Also, when to use what chart. -> 2
The due dates is still confusing. If they were in a more compiled place, it would be extremely helpful. -> 4
I seemed to understand most the material in today’s class. The only thing would be how to keep both ur box width and box number preferences -> 2
The questions we were supposed to answer for the in class activity were not sent so it was difficult to know what were supposed to do in the excel document. -> 4
I think everything that was discussed in today’s class was clear, and there was nothing really confusing in today’s class. -> 1
Nothing really was confusing to me today. -> 1
How to make a histogram properly in excel. If you showed us an example of making it in excel that would be helpful. Excel is new to everyone and it can be tricky to use it. -> 3
Nothing was confusing today. I have a good understanding of using histograms in excel. -> 1
Excel is still confusing to use. -> 4
The underflow and overflow was confusing for the bins. -> 4
nothing -> 1
Balancing number of bins and bin width -> 3
Nothing was confusing because it was just a rehash of the Brightspace modules. -> 1","I didn’t find anything confusing during class. I felt that the presentation and class overall moved at consistent and helpful speed and everything was related in a non-confusing manner. -> 1

More in depth about how to make more complicated histograms
i didn’t understand that the histograms didn’t need the date so i spent the whole break out room confused. I also think the breakout rooms should’ve been longer.
It’s a little confusing on knowing which graph or chart to use or if you can use more than one.

I feel like everything seemed to be pretty straight forward today! I was not confused about anything today! I felt that we really went over histograms well and it seemed to make sense to me!
The specific usage of histograms and how to format them correctly what a little confusing. Also how to sign up for the engineering school videos was still confusing.
I found some of the histogram making to be somewhat confusing mainly because I was on mac and did not know that I needed to add a tool kit to change the bins and basically the characteristics of the entire graph.

Balancing number of bins and bin width
Nothing needed more explanation in today’s class. I found everything to be very clear. However, I would have liked to know what kind of chart should have been submitted for the in class activity.
I’m just having a lot of trouble with excel, and I’m unable to complete many of the assignments due to this. But I’ll figure it out.
nothing
Nothing was confusing today. I have a good understanding of using histograms in excel.
What was most confusing in class today was adjusting the bin width by creating an under flow value because I would have to create a large value to make the bin width an integer and I was not sure if I was doing the correctly.
Great, productive class today. Going a bit slower on the notes would have been nice so I could write the notes.
For the in class activity, it was confusing because nobody in my group had a picture of the slides and we didnt have a way to get to them, so we werent sure on what exactly we needed to do.
I think everything was clear in today’s class. I’m starting to get the hang of it which is good so I can get in a routine.
Nothing
The most confusing part of today’s lesson was trying to determine wether to use a line chart or a histogram.
The lecture didn’t confuse me at all, but when we started assignment A07, I couldn’t figure out how to correctly change the bin widths.
Everything was pretty simple in today’s class. I didn’t really have any questions that I could not answer by reviewing the video and the slides. I am still a little confused on the EYM events.
Not much was confusing. I understood all the concepts but the only real confusing part was figuring out how to navigate excel correctly.
The underflow and overflow was confusing for the bins.
I felt comfortable today.
I was a little confused about what graph to use in the in class activity at first. Since a histogram in my mind would also be able to be used
How to make a histogram properly in excel. If you showed us an example of making it in excel that would be helpful. Excel is new to everyone and it can be tricky to use it.
I found nothing confusing today, everything made sense to me.
I think that maybe there could be more information on when you use histograms. I know it’s for distribution but still a little confused on when you use them all.
Did the homework assignment need a under flow or over flow bin?
The instructions for the in class assignment wasn’t posted in the chat until near the end of the breakout room. This made the assignment difficult to complete.
I didn’t find anything confusing during class. I felt that the presentation and class overall moved at consistent and helpful speed and everything was related in a non-confusing manner.
I wish that it was easier to see the questions or prompts when we break off into our individual groups because I had trouble working on the in class activity because I didn’t know the prompt
I was confused about how the in class quiz will work and what it is over.
As I also submitted last class, I would like the option of making questions in the class during the presentation. The thing is that the Raise Hand buttton does not show much, as some peers forget it On. I would like another button, such as the tick, to mean I have a question. Thanks.
Some parts of the in class activity were confusing but it was mainly excel stuff
I did not know what value the histogram needed to be edited at.
nothing was confusing except the bins for the histogram
The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped.
The due dates is still confusing. If they were in a more compiled place, it would be extremely helpful.
Everything was clearly explained. The only confusion was with the assignments we were working on.
Initially, I was confusing about when exactly the A03 was due, but this was cleared up part way through the lecture. I am however still wondering if I need to e-mail the professor if I turned it in 2 minutes late today from the confusion. This seemed to be an issue across the board.
It was confusing that we had done an assignment on what graph we should use for data analysis but we were taught it today in class.
I feel as though the theory of histograms was explained well but the implementation of them in excel was a little lacking.
I am confused on A05. We were not told how to process that much data on excel. I am not sure about how to complete this team assignment because I dont know how to divide this up and complete the assignment
There were parts of the directions for A07 that were unclear, like the part about calculating bin widths and using underflow bins.
I think everything that was discussed in today’s class was clear, and there was nothing really confusing in today’s class.
There is not much things that are confusing or unclear. I understand what we are gonna do and prepare for next class, and the definition and use about histogram is clear enough for me","A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful.
Excel is still confusing to use.
how to change the bin size from the assigned bins in excel 
I found everything pretty straightforward. I wish we saw the slide you were talking about that had al the due dates so we didn’t have to find it later, but other than that it was good
I am still a little confused on when the career exploration modules/quizzes are due compared to the EYM zoom meetings and attendances.
Nothing was confusing because it was just a rehash of the Brightspace modules.
I believe class today was very informative. There were definitely some question about histograms that I had answered. 
I was confused by all the due dates and the way the bright space is set up. I forgot to do assignment A06 because it wasn’t in the “To Do before class” category for class 4A
I had a hard time creating the bins in excel for assignment 7. Everything else was pretty very clear! 
Nothing was confusing
 It was confusing that we were reviewing what types of graphs were correct for a situation when we had already submitted an assignment with our choices of what graphs we thought best displayed data.
 The in class activity gave my group some confusion because it was not explained in detail, and when breakout rooms opened, we did not understand the entire assignment.
 Nothing! I feel like I understood it all today and it made sense! 
 I am still confused on how to identify Underflow Bins. 
 I was confused for a while because I have a Mac and could not figure out how to change the bin data. I figured out that u can change it by clicking on the value bar itself. It was helpful at the end that professor explained how to add the add on. I wish we were able to reference the slides while in breakout rooms.
 I’m confused on how to find overflow/underflow values.
 I had issues using excel with my Mac, couldn’t find the bins option when making a histogram. I’ve been having similar problems while doing other assignments.
 There was nothing confusing in the class today for me. I thought everything was explained very well.
 More in depth about how to make more complicated histograms
 i didn’t understand that the histograms didn’t need the date so i spent the whole break out room confused. I also think the breakout rooms should’ve been longer.
 It’s a little confusing on knowing which graph or chart to use or if you can use more than one. 
 Do i have to use a underflow on my histogram or is it just recommended? 
 Nothing really was confusing to me today. 
 The questions we were supposed to answer for the in class activity were not sent so it was difficult to know what were supposed to do in the excel document.
 I didn’t think anything was confusing even thought I was having computer troubles where I couldn’t heard anything though zoom. Other than that the histograms where explained very well.
 I think sometimes we are unable to follow the slide or the instruction was not clear enough, so I wish professor could go into detail when performing excel stuff 
 Everything was pretty clear today. The histograms we worked on were pretty self explanatory
 I still am unsure about the differences between categorical and nominal data. Also, when to use what chart. 
 I seemed to understand most the material in today’s class. The only thing would be how to keep both ur box width and box number preferences

I feel as though the theory of histograms was explained well but the implementation of them in excel was a little lacking. -> 3
I was confused for a while because I have a Mac and could not figure out how to change the bin data. I figured out that u can change it by clicking on the value bar itself.

The most confusing part of today's lesson was trying to determine wether to use a line chart or a histogram. -> 3
Nothing! I feel like I understood it all today and it made sense! -> 1
There is not much things that are confusing or unclear. I understand what we are gonna do and prepare for next class, and the definition and use about histogram is clear enough for me -> 1
I believe class today was very informative. There were definitely some question about histograms that I had answered. -> 1
Everything was pretty clear today. The histograms we worked on were pretty self explanatory -> 1
I am still a little confused on when the career exploration modules/quizzes are due compared to the EYM zoom meetings and attendances. -> 2
I found everything pretty straightforward. I wish we saw the slide you were talking about that had al the due dates so we didn't have to find it later, but other than that it was good -> 1
A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful. -> 3
I didn't think anything was confusing even thought I was having computer troubles where I couldn't heard anything though zoom. Other than that the histograms where explained very well. -> 1
I found some of the histogram making to be somewhat confusing mainly because I was on mac and did not know that I needed to add a tool kit to change the bins and basically the characteristics of the entire graph. -> 4
I think that maybe there could be more information on when you use histograms. I know it's for distribution but still a little confused on when you use them all. -> 4
There were parts of the directions for A07 that were unclear, like the part about calculating bin widths and using underflow bins. -> 3
Did the homework assignment need a under flow or over flow bin? -> 2
The in class activity gave my group some confusion because it was not explained in detail, and when breakout rooms opened, we did not understand the entire assignment. -> 4
For the in class activity, it was confusing because nobody in my group had a picture of the slides and we didnt have a way to get to them, so we werent sure on what exactly we needed to do. -> 4
As I also submitted last class, I would like the option of making questions in the class during the presentation. The thing is that the Raise Hand buttton does not show much, as some peers forget it On. I would like another button, such as the tick, to mean I have a question. Thanks. -> 2
Initially, I was confusing about when exactly the A03 was due, but this was cleared up part way through the lecture. I am however still wondering if I need to e-mail the professor if I turned it in 2 minutes late today from the confusion. This seemed to be an issue across the board. -> 2
nothing was confusing except the bins for the histogram -> 1
I felt comfortable today. -> 1
The specific usage of histograms and how to format them correctly what a little confusing. Also how to sign up for the engineering school videos was still confusing. -> 3

I had a hard time creating the bins in excel for assignment 7. Everything else was pretty very clear! -> 3
I was a little confused about what graph to use in the in class activity at first. Since a histogram in my mind would also be able to be used -> 3
Everything was clearly explained. The only confusion was with the assignments we were working on. -> 1
What was most confusing in class today was adjusting the bin width by creating an under flow value because I would have to create a large value to make the bin width an integer and I was not sure if I was doing the correctly. -> 4
Not much was confusing. I understood all the concepts but the only real confusing part was figuring out how to navigate excel correctly. -> 1
Could you send out an email or something to help us keep up with assignments? Also are the before class assignments taken as a grade? -> 2
The instructions for the in class assignment wasn't posted in the chat until near the end of the breakout room. This made the assignment difficult to complete. -> 4
I am confused on A05. We were not told how to process that much data on excel. I am not sure about how to complete this team assignment because I dont know how to divide this up and complete the assignment -> 2
how to change the bin size from the assigned bins in excel -> 3
I wish that it was easier to see the questions or prompts when we break off into our individual groups because I had trouble working on the in class activity because I didn't know the prompt -> 4

I still am unsure about the differences between categorical and nominal data. Also, when to use what chart. -> 3
The due dates is still confusing. If they were in a more compiled place, it would be extremely helpful. -> 2
I seemed to understand most the material in today's class. The only thing would be how to keep both ur box width and box number preferences -> 1

 Initially, I was confusing about when exactly the A03 was due, but this was cleared up part way through the lecture. I am however still wondering if I need to e-mail the professor if I turned it in 2 minutes late today from the confusion. This seemed to be an issue across the board.
 It was confusing that we had done an assignment on what graph we should use for data analysis but we were taught it today in class.
 I feel as though the theory of histograms was explained well but the implementation of them in excel was a little lacking.
 I am confused on A05. We were not told how to process that much data on excel. I am not sure about how to complete this team assignment because I dont know how to divide this up and complete the assignment 
 There were parts of the directions for A07 that were unclear, like the part about calculating bin widths and using underflow bins. 
 I think everything that was discussed in today's class was clear, and there was nothing really confusing in today's class.

Excel is still confusing to use.
how to change the bin size from the assigned bins in excel 
I found everything pretty straightforward. I wish we saw the slide you were talking about that had al the due dates so we didn’t have to find it later, but other than that it was good
I am still a little confused on when the career exploration modules/quizzes are due compared to the EYM zoom meetings and attendances.
Nothing was confusing because it was just a rehash of the Brightspace modules.
I believe class today was very informative. There were definitely some question about histograms that I had answered. 
I was confused by all the due dates and the way the bright space is set up. I forgot to do assignment A06 because it wasn’t in the “To Do before class” category for class 4A
I had a hard time creating the bins in excel for assignment 7. Everything else was pretty very clear! 
Nothing was confusing
 It was confusing that we were reviewing what types of graphs were correct for a situation when we had already submitted an assignment with our choices of what graphs we thought best displayed data.
 The in class activity gave my group some confusion because it was not explained in detail, and when breakout rooms opened, we did not understand the entire assignment.
 Nothing! I feel like I understood it all today and it made sense! 
 I am still confused on how to identify Underflow Bins. 
 I was confused for a while because I have a Mac and could not figure out how to change the bin data. I figured out that u can change it by clicking on the value bar itself. It was helpful at the end that professor explained how to add the add on. I wish we were able to reference the slides while in breakout rooms.
 I’m confused on how to find overflow/underflow values.
 I had issues using excel with my Mac, couldn’t find the bins option when making a histogram. I’ve been having similar problems while doing other assignments.
 There was nothing confusing in the class today for me. I thought everything was explained very well.
 More in depth about how to make more complicated histograms
 i didn’t understand that the histograms didn’t need the date so i spent the whole break out room confused. I also think the breakout rooms should’ve been longer.
 It’s a little confusing on knowing which graph or chart to use or if you can use more than one. 
 Do i have to use a underflow on my histogram or is it just recommended? 
 Nothing really was confusing to me today. 
 The questions we were supposed to answer for the in class activity were not sent so it was difficult to know what were supposed to do in the excel document.
 I didn’t think anything was confusing even thought I was having computer troubles where I couldn’t heard anything though zoom. Other than that the histograms where explained very well.
 I think sometimes we are unable to follow the slide or the instruction was not clear enough, so I wish professor could go into detail when performing excel stuff 
 Everything was pretty clear today. The histograms we worked on were pretty self explanatory
 I still am unsure about the differences between categorical and nominal data. Also, when to use what chart. 
 I seemed to understand most the material in today’s class. The only thing would be how to keep both ur box width and box number preferences 
 Could you send out an email or something to help us keep up with assignments? Also are the before class assignments taken as a grade?
 Nothing much. I think I just need to get more comfortable using histograms and understanding how to set them up using excel.
 I feel like everything seemed to be pretty straight forward today! I was not confused about anything today! I felt that we really went over histograms well and it seemed to make sense to me! 
 The specific usage of histograms and how to format them correctly what a little confusing. Also how to sign up for the engineering school videos was still confusing. 
 I found some of the histogram making to be somewhat confusing mainly because I was on mac and did not know that I needed to add a tool kit to change the bins and basically the characteristics of the entire graph. 
 Initially I was a little confused on how to manipulate certain data within the graphs using the tables but eventually I got it sorted out
 Balancing number of bins and bin width
 Nothing needed more explanation in today’s class. I found everything to be very clear. However, I would have liked to know what kind of chart should have been submitted for the in class activity. 
 I’m just having a lot of trouble with excel, and I’m unable to complete many of the assignments due to this. But I’ll figure it out.
 nothing
 Nothing was confusing today. I have a good understanding of using histograms in excel. 
 What was most confusing in class today was adjusting the bin width by creating an under flow value because I would have to create a large value to make the bin width an integer and I was not sure if I was doing the correctly.
 Great, productive class today. Going a bit slower on the notes would have been nice so I could write the notes. 
 For the in class activity, it was confusing because nobody in my group had a picture of the slides and we didnt have a way to get to them, so we werent sure on what exactly we needed to do.
 I think everything was clear in today’s class. I’m starting to get the hang of it which is good so I can get in a routine. 
 Nothing 
 The most confusing part of today’s lesson was trying to determine wether to use a line chart or a histogram.
 The lecture didn’t confuse me at all, but when we started assignment A07, I couldn’t figure out how to correctly change the bin widths.
 Everything was pretty simple in today’s class. I didn’t really have any questions that I could not answer by reviewing the video and the slides. I am still a little confused on the EYM events.
 Not much was confusing. I understood all the concepts but the only real confusing part was figuring out how to navigate excel correctly.
 The underflow and overflow was confusing for the bins.
 I felt comfortable today.
 I was a little confused about what graph to use in the in class activity at first. Since a histogram in my mind would also be able to be used
 How to make a histogram properly in excel. If you showed us an example of making it in excel that would be helpful. Excel is new to everyone and it can be tricky to use it. 
 I found nothing confusing today, everything made sense to me.
 I think that maybe there could be more information on when you use histograms. I know it’s for distribution but still a little confused on when you use them all.
 Did the homework assignment need a under flow or over flow bin?
 The instructions for the in class assignment wasn’t posted in the chat until near the end of the breakout room. This made the assignment difficult to complete.
 I didn’t find anything confusing during class. I felt that the presentation and class overall moved at consistent and helpful speed and everything was related in a non-confusing manner.
 I wish that it was easier to see the questions or prompts when we break off into our individual groups because I had trouble working on the in class activity because I didn’t know the prompt
 I was confused about how the in class quiz will work and what it is over. 
 As I also submitted last class, I would like the option of making questions in the class during the presentation. The thing is that the Raise Hand buttton does not show much, as some peers forget it On. I would like another button, such as the tick, to mean I have a question. Thanks.
 Some parts of the in class activity were confusing but it was mainly excel stuff
 I did not know what value the histogram needed to be edited at. 
 nothing was confusing except the bins for the histogram
 The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped.
 The due dates is still confusing. If they were in a more compiled place, it would be extremely helpful.

Everything was pretty simple in today’s class. I didn’t really have any questions that I could not answer by reviewing the video and the slides. I am still a little confused on the EYM events. -> 1
I had a hard time creating the bins in excel for assignment 7. Everything else was pretty very clear! -> 4
I was a little confused about what graph to use in the in class activity at first. Since a histogram in my mind would also be able to be used -> 2
Everything was clearly explained. The only confusion was with the assignments we were working on. -> 1
What was most confusing in class today was adjusting the bin width by creating an under flow value because I would have to create a large value to make the bin width an integer and I was not sure if I was doing the correctly. -> 3
Not much was confusing. I understood all the concepts but the only real confusing part was figuring out how to navigate excel correctly. -> 2
Could you send out an email or something to help us keep up with assignments? Also are the before class assignments taken as a grade? -> 3
The instructions for the in class assignment wasn’t posted in the chat until near the end of the breakout room. This made the assignment difficult to complete. -> 3
I am confused on A05. We were not told how to process that much data on excel. I am not sure about how to complete this team assignment because I dont know how to divide this up and complete the assignment -> 4
how to change the bin size from the assigned bins in excel -> 3
I wish that it was easier to see the questions or prompts when we break off into our individual groups because I had trouble working on the in class activity because I didn’t know the prompt -> 1

There was nothing confusing in the class today for me. I thought everything was explained very well. -> 1
I am still confused on how to identify Underflow Bins. -> 4
I found nothing confusing today, everything made sense to me. -> 1
The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped. -> 3
I still am unsure about the differences between categorical and nominal data. Also, when to use what chart. -> 2
The due dates is still confusing. If they were in a more compiled place, it would be extremely helpful. -> 4
I seemed to understand most the material in today’s class. The only thing would be how to keep both ur box width and box number preferences -> 2
The questions we were supposed to answer for the in class activity were not sent so it was difficult to know what were supposed to do in the excel document. -> 4
I think everything that was discussed in today’s class was clear, and there was nothing really confusing in today’s class. -> 1
Nothing really was confusing to me today. -> 1
How to make a histogram properly in excel. If you showed us an example of making it in excel that would be helpful. Excel is new to everyone and it can be tricky to use it. -> 3

It was confusing that we were reviewing what types of graphs were correct for a situation when we had already submitted an assignment with our choices of what graphs we thought best displayed data. -> 3
It was confusing that we had done an assignment on what graph we should use for data analysis but we were taught it today in class. -> 3
I was confused by all the due dates and the way the bright space is set up. I forgot to do assignment A06 because it wasn’t in the “To Do before class” category for class 4A -> 2
It’s a little confusing on knowing which graph or chart to use or if you can use more than one. -> 3
More in depth about how to make more complicated histograms -> 3
Some parts of the in class activity were confusing but it was mainly excel stuff -> 3
The lecture didn’t confuse me at all, but when we started assignment A07, I couldn’t figure out how to correctly change the bin widths. -> 1
i didn’t understand that the histograms didn’t need the date so i spent the whole break out room confused. I also think the breakout rooms should’ve been longer. -> 4
I did not know what value the histogram needed to be edited at. -> 3
Nothing was confusing -> 1
I was confused about how the in class quiz will work and what it is over. -> 2
Nothing needed more explanation in today’s class. I found everything to be very clear. However, I would have liked to know what kind of chart should have been submitted for the in class activity. -> 1
Nothing much. I think I just need to get more comfortable using histograms and understanding how to set them up using excel. -> 1
I feel like everything seemed to be pretty straight forward today! I was not confused about anything today! I felt that we really went over histograms well and it seemed to make sense to me! -> 1
Do i have to use a underflow on my histogram or is it just recommended? -> 3
I think sometimes we are unable to follow the slide or the instruction was not clear enough, so I wish professor could go into detail when performing excel stuff -> 4
Nothing -> 1
Initially I was a little confused on how to manipulate certain data within the graphs using the tables but eventually I got it sorted out -> 1
I had issues using excel with my Mac, couldn’t find the bins option when making a histogram. I’ve been having similar problems while doing other assignments. -> 2
I’m just having a lot of trouble with excel, and I’m unable to complete many of the assignments due to this. But I’ll figure it out. -> 4
I’m confused on how to find overflow/underflow values. -> 3
I feel as though the theory of histograms was explained well but the implementation of them in excel was a little lacking. -> 3
I was confused for a while because I have a Mac and could not figure out how to change the bin data. I figured out that u can change it by clicking on the value bar itself. It was helpful at the end that professor explained how to add the add on. I wish we were able to reference the slides while in breakout rooms. -> 3
The most confusing part of today’s lesson was trying to determine wether to use a line chart or a histogram. -> 3
Nothing! I feel like I understood it all today and it made sense! -> 1
There is not much things that are confusing or unclear. I understand what we are gonna do and prepare for next class, and the definition and use about histogram is clear enough for me -> 1
I believe class today was very informative. There were definitely some question about histograms that I had answered. -> 1
Everything was pretty clear today. The histograms we worked on were pretty self explanatory -> 1
I am still a little confused on when the career exploration modules/quizzes are due compared to the EYM zoom meetings and attendances. -> 2
I found everything pretty straightforward. I wish we saw the slide you were talking about that had al the due dates so we didn’t have to find it later, but other than that it was good -> 1
A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful. -> 3
I didn’t think anything was confusing even thought I was having computer troubles where I couldn’t heard anything though zoom. Other than that the histograms where explained very well. -> 1
I found some of the histogram making to be somewhat confusing mainly because I was on mac and did not know that I needed to add a tool kit to change the bins and basically the characteristics of the entire graph. -> 4
I think that maybe there could be more information on when you use histograms. I know it’s for distribution but still a little confused on when you use them all. -> 4
There were parts of the directions for A07 that were unclear, like the part about calculating bin widths and using underflow bins. -> 3
Did the homework assignment need a under flow or over flow bin? -> 2
The in class activity gave my group some confusion because it was not explained in detail, and when breakout rooms opened, we did not understand the entire assignment. -> 4
For the in class activity, it was confusing because nobody in my group had a picture of the slides and we didnt have a way to get to them, so we werent sure on what exactly we needed to do. -> 4
As I also submitted last class, I would like the option of making questions in the class during the presentation. The thing is that the Raise Hand buttton does not show much, as some peers forget it On. I would like another button, such as the tick, to mean I have a question. Thanks. -> 2
Initially, I was confusing about when exactly the A03 was due, but this was cleared up part way through the lecture. I am however still wondering if I need to e-mail the professor if I turned it in 2 minutes late today from the confusion. This seemed to be an issue across the board. -> 2

 I had issues using excel with my Mac, couldn’t find the bins option when making a histogram. I’ve been having similar problems while doing other assignments.
 There was nothing confusing in the class today for me. I thought everything was explained very well.
 More in depth about how to make more complicated histograms
 i didn’t understand that the histograms didn’t need the date so i spent the whole break out room confused. I also think the breakout rooms should’ve been longer.
 It’s a little confusing on knowing which graph or chart to use or if you can use more than one. 
 Do i have to use a underflow on my histogram or is it just recommended? 
 Nothing really was confusing to me today. 
 The questions we were supposed to answer for the in class activity were not sent so it was difficult to know what were supposed to do in the excel document.
 I didn’t think anything was confusing even thought I was having computer troubles where I couldn’t heard anything though zoom. Other than that the histograms where explained very well.
 I think sometimes we are unable to follow the slide or the instruction was not clear enough, so I wish professor could go into detail when performing excel stuff 
 Everything was pretty clear today. The histograms we worked on were pretty self explanatory
 I still am unsure about the differences between categorical and nominal data. Also, when to use what chart. 
 I seemed to understand most the material in today’s class. The only thing would be how to keep both ur box width and box number preferences 
 Could you send out an email or something to help us keep up with assignments? Also are the before class assignments taken as a grade?
 Nothing much. I think I just need to get more comfortable using histograms and understanding how to set them up using excel.
 I feel like everything seemed to be pretty straight forward today! I was not confused about anything today! I felt that we really went over histograms well and it seemed to make sense to me! 
 The specific usage of histograms and how to format them correctly what a little confusing. Also how to sign up for the engineering school videos was still confusing. 
 I found some of the histogram making to be somewhat confusing mainly because I was on mac and did not know that I needed to add a tool kit to change the bins and basically the characteristics of the entire graph. 
 Initially I was a little confused on how to manipulate certain data within the graphs using the tables but eventually I got it sorted out
 Balancing number of bins and bin width
 Nothing needed more explanation in today’s class. I found everything to be very clear. However, I would have liked to know what kind of chart should have been submitted for the in class activity. 
 I’m just having a lot of trouble with excel, and I’m unable to complete many of the assignments due to this. But I’ll figure it out.
 nothing
 Nothing was confusing today. I have a good understanding of using histograms in excel. 
 What was most confusing in class today was adjusting the bin width by creating an under flow value because I would have to create a large value to make the bin width an integer and I was not sure if I was doing the correctly.
 Great, productive class today. Going a bit slower on the notes would have been nice so I could write the notes. 
 For the in class activity, it was confusing because nobody in my group had a picture of the slides and we didnt have a way to get to them, so we werent sure on what exactly we needed to do.
 I think everything was clear in today’s class. I’m starting to get the hang of it which is good so I can get in a routine. 
 Nothing 
 The most confusing part of today’s lesson was trying to determine wether to use a line chart or a histogram.
 The lecture didn’t confuse me at all, but when we started assignment A07, I couldn’t figure out how to correctly change the bin widths.
 Everything was pretty simple in today’s class. I didn’t really have any questions that I could not answer by reviewing the video and the slides. I am still a little confused on the EYM events.
 Not much was confusing. I understood all the concepts but the only real confusing part was figuring out how to navigate excel correctly.
 The underflow and overflow was confusing for the bins.
 I felt comfortable today.
 I was a little confused about what graph to use in the in class activity at first. Since a histogram in my mind would also be able to be used
 How to make a histogram properly in excel. If you showed us an example of making it in excel that would be helpful. Excel is new to everyone and it can be tricky to use it. 
 I found nothing confusing today, everything made sense to me.
 I think that maybe there could be more information on when you use histograms. I know it’s for distribution but still a little confused on when you use them all.
 Did the homework assignment need a under flow or over flow bin?
 The instructions for the in class assignment wasn’t posted in the chat until near the end of the breakout room. This made the assignment difficult to complete.
 I didn’t find anything confusing during class. I felt that the presentation and class overall moved at consistent and helpful speed and everything was related in a non-confusing manner.
 I wish that it was easier to see the questions or prompts when we break off into our individual groups because I had trouble working on the in class activity because I didn’t know the prompt
 I was confused about how the in class quiz will work and what it is over. 
 As I also submitted last class, I would like the option of making questions in the class during the presentation. The thing is that the Raise Hand buttton does not show much, as some peers forget it On. I would like another button, such as the tick, to mean I have a question. Thanks.
 Some parts of the in class activity were confusing but it was mainly excel stuff
 I did not know what value the histogram needed to be edited at. 
 nothing was confusing except the bins for the histogram
 The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped.
 The due dates is still confusing. If they were in a more compiled place, it would be extremely helpful.
 Everything was clearly explained. The only confusion was with the assignments we were working on.
 Initially, I was confusing about when exactly the A03 was due, but this was cleared up part way through the lecture. I am however still wondering if I need to e-mail the professor if I turned it in 2 minutes late today from the confusion. This seemed to be an issue across the board.
 It was confusing that we had done an assignment on what graph we should use for data analysis but we were taught it today in class.
 I feel as though the theory of histograms was explained well but the implementation of them in excel was a little lacking.
 I am confused on A05. We were not told how to process that much data on excel. I am not sure about how to complete this team assignment because I dont know how to divide this up and complete the assignment 
 There were parts of the directions for A07 that were unclear, like the part about calculating bin widths and using underflow bins. 
 I think everything that was discussed in today’s class was clear, and there was nothing really confusing in today’s class.
 There is not much things that are confusing or unclear. I understand what we are gonna do and prepare for next class, and the definition and use about histogram is clear enough for me","It seems that a majority of the issues that students had with this class had to do with Excel. It seems that they mainly had difficulty with the overflow and/or the underflow bins. Additionally, there were several issues involving the creation of the histograms. There also seems to be confusion regarding assignments and also due dates. It might be useful for the professor to go over any confusion regarding the assignments, and to review the due dates of upcoming assignments.",A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful.

 It’s a little confusing on knowing which graph or chart to use or if you can use more than one. 
 Do i have to use a underflow on my histogram or is it just recommended? 
 Nothing really was confusing to me today. 
 The questions we were supposed to answer for the in class activity were not sent so it was difficult to know what were supposed to do in the excel document.
 I didn’t think anything was confusing even thought I was having computer troubles where I couldn’t heard anything though zoom. Other than that the histograms where explained very well.
 I think sometimes we are unable to follow the slide or the instruction was not clear enough, so I wish professor could go into detail when performing excel stuff 
 Everything was pretty clear today. The histograms we worked on were pretty self explanatory
 I still am unsure about the differences between categorical and nominal data. Also, when to use what chart. 
 I seemed to understand most the material in today’s class. The only thing would be how to keep both ur box width and box number preferences 
 Could you send out an email or something to help us keep up with assignments? Also are the before class assignments taken as a grade?
 Nothing much. I think I just need to get more comfortable using histograms and understanding how to set them up using excel.
 I feel like everything seemed to be pretty straight forward today! I was not confused about anything today! I felt that we really went over histograms well and it seemed to make sense to me! 
 The specific usage of histograms and how to format them correctly what a little confusing. Also how to sign up for the engineering school videos was still confusing. 
 I found some of the histogram making to be somewhat confusing mainly because I was on mac and did not know that I needed to add a tool kit to change the bins and basically the characteristics of the entire graph. 
 Initially I was a little confused on how to manipulate certain data within the graphs using the tables but eventually I got it sorted out
 Balancing number of bins and bin width
 Nothing needed more explanation in today’s class. I found everything to be very clear. However, I would have liked to know what kind of chart should have been submitted for the in class activity. 
 I’m just having a lot of trouble with excel, and I’m unable to complete many of the assignments due to this. But I’ll figure it out.
 nothing
 Nothing was confusing today. I have a good understanding of using histograms in excel. 
 What was most confusing in class today was adjusting the bin width by creating an under flow value because I would have to create a large value to make the bin width an integer and I was not sure if I was doing the correctly.
 Great, productive class today. Going a bit slower on the notes would have been nice so I could write the notes. 
 For the in class activity, it was confusing because nobody in my group had a picture of the slides and we didnt have a way to get to them, so we werent sure on what exactly we needed to do.
 I think everything was clear in today’s class. I’m starting to get the hang of it which is good so I can get in a routine. 
 Nothing 
 The most confusing part of today’s lesson was trying to determine wether to use a line chart or a histogram.
 The lecture didn’t confuse me at all, but when we started assignment A07, I couldn’t figure out how to correctly change the bin widths.
 Everything was pretty simple in today’s class. I didn’t really have any questions that I could not answer by reviewing the video and the slides. I am still a little confused on the EYM events.
 Not much was confusing. I understood all the concepts but the only real confusing part was figuring out how to navigate excel correctly.
 The underflow and overflow was confusing for the bins.
 I felt comfortable today.
 I was a little confused about what graph to use in the in class activity at first. Since a histogram in my mind would also be able to be used
 How to make a histogram properly in excel. If you showed us an example of making it in excel that would be helpful. Excel is new to everyone and it can be tricky to use it. 
 I found nothing confusing today, everything made sense to me.
 I think that maybe there could be more information on when you use histograms. I know it’s for distribution but still a little confused on when you use them all.
 Did the homework assignment need a under flow or over flow bin?
 The instructions for the in class assignment wasn’t posted in the chat until near the end of the breakout room. This made the assignment difficult to complete.
 I didn’t find anything confusing during class. I felt that the presentation and class overall moved at consistent and helpful speed and everything was related in a non-confusing manner.
 I wish that it was easier to see the questions or prompts when we break off into our individual groups because I had trouble working on the in class activity because I didn’t know the prompt
 I was confused about how the in class quiz will work and what it is over. 
 As I also submitted last class, I would like the option of making questions in the class during the presentation. The thing is that the Raise Hand buttton does not show much, as some peers forget it On. I would like another button, such as the tick, to mean I have a question. Thanks.
 Some parts of the in class activity were confusing but it was mainly excel stuff
 I did not know what value the histogram needed to be edited at. 
 nothing was confusing except the bins for the histogram
 The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped.
 The due dates is still confusing. If they were in a more compiled place, it would be extremely helpful.
 Everything was clearly explained. The only confusion was with the assignments we were working on.
 Initially, I was confusing about when exactly the A03 was due, but this was cleared up part way through the lecture. I am however still wondering if I need to e-mail the professor if I turned it in 2 minutes late today from the confusion. This seemed to be an issue across the board.
 It was confusing that we had done an assignment on what graph we should use for data analysis but we were taught it today in class.
 I feel as though the theory of histograms was explained well but the implementation of them in excel was a little lacking.
 I am confused on A05. We were not told how to process that much data on excel. I am not sure about how to complete this team assignment because I dont know how to divide this up and complete the assignment 
 There were parts of the directions for A07 that were unclear, like the part about calculating bin widths and using underflow bins. 
 I think everything that was discussed in today’s class was clear, and there was nothing really confusing in today’s class.
 There is not much things that are confusing or unclear. I understand what we are gonna do and prepare for next class, and the definition and use about histogram is clear enough for me","Balancing number of bins and bin width A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful. I still am unsure about the differences between categorical and nominal data. Also, when to use what chart. The specific usage of histograms and how to format them correctly what a little confusing.

I thought learning about the hydroelectric power was interesting
I found the complexity of hydroelectricity and the application of it in terms of our assignment to be interesting.
Class today went really well. The class discussion was very helpful, with what the company gave us and what we needed to find. I also believe that the work time at the end is very nice to half to get everything organized for our group to work on the project.
I found the discussion about Taum Sauk and how the hydropower generators work!
I’ve never had to use APA before this class, so that will be interesting
I liked how this upcoming project is more straightforward and more of the engineering I’m used to versus just plain data analysis. There is more formulas and things that I find fun.
The idea that the Taum Sauk Reservoir is basically a free standing dam, but that it failed before and causes problems. However, we did not talk much as a group about the concepts behind it.
The details of the new project we are beginning
I liked all the time we got to work on A10 and I also liked how we were able to ask Neel questions if we were confused. It helped tremendously.
I found learning about generators was interesting. I hope we get to learn more about how electricity is generated in future projects and assignments.
The reservoir
I liked working with my group today
hydropower is cool. I really like the Hoover dam. its important to note that despite being a renewable source of power, hydropower has one of the largest environmental impacts
I thought that the introduction to the project and the data that came with it was interesting. I also liked the in class discussions of how information could be gathered and what questions to ask.
Seeing the mechanics of how reservoirs work
I liked how we had group discussions I also liked how we got ahead on an assignment due next week and that we were given more time to work on projects so that we aren’t cramming many at once.
I found the google scholar activity interesting. I enjoy doing research and liked getting the practice finding and citing different articles.
I found the new project we are starting very interesting. The fact that it can hold up to 1.5 billion gallons of water is insane.
I found the hydropower generator interesting. I didn’t really know how the generator converted mechanical energy into electric until today.
Knowing about the articles and reliable sources available from the purdue library, that’s good information to have.
How hydropower generators worked
I enjoyed learning about hydropower and the company this project is based off of.
I found the hydropower part interesting as I had previously learned some of this stuff in physics.
What I found most interesting in today’s class was how the whole process of hydropower works and how it creates power.
I enjoyed learning about the Taum Sauk Reservoir and how it works and the failure that happened.
Today I was able to work with my group and we found out that Microsoft does have a sharing system which we heavily took advantage of. I am very happy with our group work and this will give us even better results.
I found it interesting getting to see how the reservoir works and the applications of it that we will be analyzing.
The dam
What I found most interesting is the taum Sauk reservoir and the failure that it had
I found the video about how the reservoir works interesting
I found learning about how hydroelectric dams work to be most interesting. It’s nice when you learn a little science on the side. Like a science side salad. With feta cheese.
I found the explanation of hydroelectric power interesting and I am excited for this next project we are undertaking.
the way that hydroelectric plants work was pretty interesting
I found it interesting about the different ways you can find a relatable source. It is helpful to know more that one way to do so
This reservoir is massive! Very interesting to research and I am excited to look into the data and learn more.
The whole concept is very interesting, using data and working with a dam is much more interesting than the bike share project
I found interesting about using google scholar and integrating Purdue data base with it.
I think learning about the reservoir, and doing some research on the history of the resource and about hydropower generators.  I think the introduction of a new project was very infesting. I also found the intro into how to cite and reference your sources to be very informative.

The introduction to the new assignment
i found that the way that hydroelectric power is used is a very unique way. I knew a little about it, but i’m excited for the project that we’re doing to learn more about this. Also, i thought the amount of engineers working on dams was very interesting.
The most interesting thing was looking into the past history of the Taum Sauk Reservoir.
I found the modeling aspect of the new assignment interesting. I’m excited to learn more about that and figure the project out.
The Taum Sauk reservoir is an upper reservoir that failed and had an accident before.

A10 about the Taum Sauk Reservoir seems like it will be more intense than the Bike Share assignments. I believe that as a group, we will improve on the new set of assignments
It was interesting to learn about the different types of resources we are allowed to use and it was interesting to research the Taum Sauk Reservoir.
I really like the taum Sauk project we are working on next and I think it will be very interesting because we get to model the system
Working on real projects that are also interesting
The pictures of the dam were amazing and it was interesting to use google scholar

I’ve never had to use APA before this class, so that will be interesting -> 3
I found the discussion about Taum Sauk and how the hydropower generators work! -> 5
I found the new project we are starting very interesting. The fact that it can hold up to 1.5 billion gallons of water is insane. -> 3
A10 about the Taum Sauk Reservoir seems like it will be more intense than the Bike Share assignments. I believe that as a group, we will improve on the new set of assignments -> 4

This reservoir is massive! Very interesting to research and I am excited to look into the data and learn more.
The whole concept is very interesting, using data and working with a dam is much more interesting than the bike share project
I found interesting about using google scholar and integrating Purdue data base with it.
I think learning about the reservoir, and doing some research on the history of the resource and about hydropower generators.  I think the introduction of a new project was very infesting. I also found the intro into how to cite and reference your sources to be very informative.
I thought learning about hydropower, the Taum Sauk reservoir, and a whole new project was interesting.

The introduction to the new assignment
i found that the way that hydroelectric power is used is a very unique way. I knew a little about it, but i’m excited for the project that we’re doing to learn more about this. Also, i thought the amount of engineers working on dams was very interesting.
The most interesting thing was looking into the past history of the Taum Sauk Reservoir.
I found the modeling aspect of the new assignment interesting. I’m excited to learn more about that and figure the project out.
The Taum Sauk reservoir is an upper reservoir that failed and had an accident before.

A10 about the Taum Sauk Reservoir seems like it will be more intense than the Bike Share assignments. I believe that as a group, we will improve on the new set of assignments
It was interesting to learn about the different types of resources we are allowed to use and it was interesting to research the Taum Sauk Reservoir.
I really like the taum Sauk project we are working on next and I think it will be very interesting because we get to model the system
Working on real projects that are also interesting
The pictures of the dam were amazing and it was interesting to use google scholar
Learning about hydropower was most interesting.
the hydro powered generators
I found that learning about the Taum Sauk reservoir was very interesting.
This class was a little dry, but the introduction to the project helped to clear up some thing that could have been confusing in the future.
Learning about hydroelectric damns was interesting. This is because its a new and renweable power source with clear tradeoffs
I found the introduction of our next project very interesting today. Also, I feel like the time spent in breakout rooms during this lecture was much better than previous calls.
Hydropower is a very interesting concept that was talked about.
I found that it was important when we talked about information literacy
I thought the way that HEP works was very interesting","I enjoyed looking at the statistics and working with my group in class 4a. 
Researching about the reservoir was interesting.
I thought learning about the hydroelectric power was interesting
I found the complexity of hydroelectricity and the application of it in terms of our assignment to be interesting.
Class today went really well. The class discussion was very helpful, with what the company gave us and what we needed to find. I also believe that the work time at the end is very nice to half to get everything organized for our group to work on the project. 
I found the discussion about Taum Sauk and how the hydropower generators work!  
I’ve never had to use APA before this class, so that will be interesting
I liked how this upcoming project is more straightforward and more of the engineering I’m used to versus just plain data analysis. There is more formulas and things that I find fun.
The idea that the Taum Sauk Reservoir is basically a free standing dam, but that it failed before and causes problems. However, we did not talk much as a group about the concepts behind it.
The details of the new project we are beginning
 I liked all the time we got to work on A10 and I also liked how we were able to ask Neel questions if we were confused. It helped tremendously.
 I found learning about generators was interesting. I hope we get to learn more about how electricity is generated in future projects and assignments.
 The reservoir
 I liked working with my group today
 hydropower is cool. I really like the Hoover dam. its important to note that despite being a renewable source of power, hydropower has one of the largest environmental impacts
 I thought that the introduction to the project and the data that came with it was interesting. I also liked the in class discussions of how information could be gathered and what questions to ask.
 Seeing the mechanics of how reservoirs work 
 I liked how we had group discussions I also liked how we got ahead on an assignment due next week and that we were given more time to work on projects so that we aren’t cramming many at once.
 I found the google scholar activity interesting. I enjoy doing research and liked getting the practice finding and citing different articles. 
 I found the new project we are starting very interesting. The fact that it can hold up to 1.5 billion gallons of water is insane.
 I found the hydropower generator interesting. I didn’t really know how the generator converted mechanical energy into electric until today. 
 Knowing about the articles and reliable sources available from the purdue library, that’s good information to have. 
 How hydropower generators worked
 I enjoyed learning about hydropower and the company this project is based off of.
 I found the hydropower part interesting as I had previously learned some of this stuff in physics. 
 What I found most interesting in today’s class was how the whole process of hydropower works and how it creates power.
 I enjoyed learning about the Taum Sauk Reservoir and how it works and the failure that happened. 
 Today I was able to work with my group and we found out that Microsoft does have a sharing system which we heavily took advantage of. I am very happy with our group work and this will give us even better results. 
 I found it interesting getting to see how the reservoir works and the applications of it that we will be analyzing. 
 The dam
 What I found most interesting is the taum Sauk reservoir and the failure that it had
 I found the video about how the reservoir works interesting 
 I found learning about how hydroelectric dams work to be most interesting. It’s nice when you learn a little science on the side. Like a science side salad. With feta cheese.
 I found the explanation of hydroelectric power interesting and I am excited for this next project we are undertaking.

using different graphs for different data sets
Learning to use various charts in different contexts.
I enjoyed learning about how to make histograms in excel for the most part, excluding the bit that lacked explanation that I mentioned earlier
I found the histograms the most interesting today. Earlier in the A03 assignment I was having trouble figuring out how charts worked and making intervals, so learning about bins was really helpful.
The information about which plots are best used for which questions.
Learning how to make histograms one excel. Working in breakout rooms.
I like the part where we can engage with class. More of that would be nice as well as the polls you did before.
I liked that we were starting to get a bit more into statistics and excel, both are used heavily in chemical engineering
I found the idea that Excell can process so much data and give relevant graphics out of it interesting today.
I found it interesting how to use a histogram
I enjoyed working with the in-class activity for today because it helped me understand the creation of graphs in Microsoft Excell.
I am really enjoying group work and I find it very easy to communicate and engage with my team. We help each other whenever something is confusing and I’m happy that I got grouped with them!
how histograms could be applied to summarize data sets and their associated distributions.
Today we got to review histograms and check in with our group members about our project. The new project seems exciting and fun to do
The in class activity
I found that the group time was very helpful because I learned how to make histograms on excel and change the boxes
histograms.
I think the review of graphs was very interesting as it helped clarify the differences between them. I definitely used the wrong graphs for the previous assignments due today, but this class helped clarify the differences.
How to create a histogram.
I liked learning about finding out how to graph different variables. I also found how the histograms and the use of the statistics function useful.
What I found most interesting in today’s class was the implementation of examples to give students a more broad demonstration of histograms. I found it interesting how changing the type of data could completely change whether or not a certain graph was the better choice to use."," Test
I enjoyed the studio time working with my group on our assignments. We got a lot done. 
I really like statistics so I love learning about data distribution and skew and what changes how a group of data presents itself. 
Using excel learning histograms
The part I found most interesting in today’s class was how well histograms display the distribution of data. 
The web chart explaining what charts we can use in excel depending on what information we have been given.
It was interesting in today’s class to learn about how to create histograms in excel and how to format them properly.
Difference between the graphs 
The histogram calculations were the most interesting.
I liked going over the graphs more
I liked that we got to work with our groups on the infividual assignments
 The usefulness of histograms is great.
 i found the histogram and the A07 interesting to figure out
 The clarification on what type of graph to make for each type of data
 I found interesting the section in which we were shown which chart is best for different data.
 I found the way histograms are able to fit data points into bins interesting.
 I found it interesting to see how many different graphs would work for a set of data
 The flow chart showing which chart to use depending on the type of data being presented. 
 I found it interesting that time can be both continuous or discrete data depending on the context it is used in. For example, in the bike problem, the time is seen as discrete, as bike usage is recorded at certain hours of the day and cannot be determined for any times in between these. 
 The helpfulness of histograms and their ability to display data
 I think the practice with histograms was really important because it cleared up a lot of my confusion and I feel like I understand it much better now.
 I found making histograms to be most interesting. 
 What i found most interesting in todays class was picking the chart types. I found myself struggling with that in the activities so practicing with graph types and data was helpful and interesting to me.
 Histograms and line charts can both be used to show patterns in data where the data are, for example, the total number of bikers during each hour of the day. 
 I found the graph review most interesting. I liked how many graphs would fit a certain scenario, but ones fit better than others, and this was explained in the lecture today. I also thought it was important that the histograms were reviewed. I also thought it was important that the due dates are posted sometime in the class period, either at the beginning or end. 
 I enjoyed analyzing the data for the CoGo bike share users to determine periods of low usage. It was interesting to interpret this data.
 The things that can be shown with a histogram was very interesting. I found it cool that so many things can be gathered with this simple chart.
 Learning about histograms
 I really enjoyed learning about histograms and how to implement them and how they organize data. 
 I enjoyed learning the different ways in which histograms are made. Also the career exploration seems interesting.
 There were many different options for making graphs and changing the formatting.
 The cool histograms were pretty awesome to see. Looking at the different visualizations is nice.
 I found the various uses of histograms to be the most compelling part of today’s class. I had never thought about the various ways you could use histograms.
 The histogram plotting and the activity A07
 I thought working thought making histograms was very useful. Online classes can make this type of learning hard through videos but walkthroughs are much more beneficial.
 I found most interesting how to calculate for bins and range. 
 The most interesting thing about class today was learning about how to use histograms, and when the best times to use a histogram are (like what the best data for a histogram is).
 Continued use of Excel has interested me because I never knew just how useful it was with interpreting data.
 I found the assignment 07 was the most interesting because it’s helping me understand how to use excel. Excel is tricky for first time users but I’m starting to get the hang of it
 I thought the way to create histograms was most interesting because it’s cool to see how data shakes out. 
 I like how the histograms works and implementing them sounds very useful when analyzing data.
 I found the histogram information interesting as they are a type of table I don’t often use.
 Creating histograms and modifying them to make them more useful

 I found the graph review most interesting. I liked how many graphs would fit a certain scenario, but ones fit better than others, and this was explained in the lecture today. I also thought it was important that the histograms were reviewed. I also thought it was important that the due dates are posted sometime in the class period, either at the beginning or end. 
 I enjoyed analyzing the data for the CoGo bike share users to determine periods of low usage. It was interesting to interpret this data.
 The things that can be shown with a histogram was very interesting. I found it cool that so many things can be gathered with this simple chart.
 Learning about histograms
 I really enjoyed learning about histograms and how to implement them and how they organize data. 
 I enjoyed learning the different ways in which histograms are made. Also the career exploration seems interesting.
 There were many different options for making graphs and changing the formatting.
 The cool histograms were pretty awesome to see. Looking at the different visualizations is nice.
 I found the various uses of histograms to be the most compelling part of today’s class. I had never thought about the various ways you could use histograms.
 The histogram plotting and the activity A07
 I thought working thought making histograms was very useful. Online classes can make this type of learning hard through videos but walkthroughs are much more beneficial.
 I found most interesting how to calculate for bins and range. 
 The most interesting thing about class today was learning about how to use histograms, and when the best times to use a histogram are (like what the best data for a histogram is).
 Continued use of Excel has interested me because I never knew just how useful it was with interpreting data.
 I found the assignment 07 was the most interesting because it’s helping me understand how to use excel. Excel is tricky for first time users but I’m starting to get the hang of it
 I thought the way to create histograms was most interesting because it’s cool to see how data shakes out. 
 I like how the histograms works and implementing them sounds very useful when analyzing data.
 I found the histogram information interesting as they are a type of table I don’t often use.
 Creating histograms and modifying them to make them more useful
 I found how you can draw certain conclusions from histograms interesting. 
 The use of histograms as a potential replacement of a line graph in order to represent some data more effectively 
 Talking about how to create a histogram in excel because excel can be confusing to work with so this was really helpful. I was a little confused on assignment 7 so that was a good overview of what to do.
 How much I was able to get done during the class period, we just kept wasting time and I made progress on 3B
 The most interesting thing Is probably the guide for mac user, which is extremely helpful 
 What I found most interesting from this class was how histograms can be used to analyze data.
 The introduction to histograms and how to use them was pretty interesting. It will be a helpful tool in the future. 
 I found the used of different graphs and what situations were best to uses what graphs interesting. 
 I found it interesting learning how to represent different data with different charts
 Learning more about my breakout group
 The use of excel to create histograms and other charts.
 The most interesting part of class was learning another type of visual representation of data through the histogram. 
 The most interesting thing I got from today’s class were the chart type flow charts and getting the general outline of the quiz
 using different graphs for different data sets
 Learning to use various charts in different contexts.
 I enjoyed learning about how to make histograms in excel for the most part, excluding the bit that lacked explanation that I mentioned earlier
 I found the histograms the most interesting today. Earlier in the A03 assignment I was having trouble figuring out how charts worked and making intervals, so learning about bins was really helpful.
 The information about which plots are best used for which questions.
 Learning how to make histograms one excel. Working in breakout rooms.
 I like the part where we can engage with class. More of that would be nice as well as the polls you did before.
 I liked that we were starting to get a bit more into statistics and excel, both are used heavily in chemical engineering
 I found the idea that Excell can process so much data and give relevant graphics out of it interesting today. 
 I found it interesting how to use a histogram 
 I enjoyed working with the in-class activity for today because it helped me understand the creation of graphs in Microsoft Excell.
 I am really enjoying group work and I find it very easy to communicate and engage with my team. We help each other whenever something is confusing and I’m happy that I got grouped with them!
 how histograms could be applied to summarize data sets and their associated distributions.
 Today we got to review histograms and check in with our group members about our project. The new project seems exciting and fun to do
 The in class activity 
 I found that the group time was very helpful because I learned how to make histograms on excel and change the boxes
 histograms. 
 I think the review of graphs was very interesting as it helped clarify the differences between them. I definitely used the wrong graphs for the previous assignments due today, but this class helped clarify the differences. 
 How to create a histogram. 
 I liked learning about finding out how to graph different variables. I also found how the histograms and the use of the statistics function useful. 
 What I found most interesting in today’s class was the implementation of examples to give students a more broad demonstration of histograms. I found it interesting how changing the type of data could completely change whether or not a certain graph was the better choice to use.",I think the review of graphs was very interesting as it helped clarify the differences between them.

Using excel learning histograms
The part I found most interesting in today’s class was how well histograms display the distribution of data. 
The web chart explaining what charts we can use in excel depending on what information we have been given.
It was interesting in today’s class to learn about how to create histograms in excel and how to format them properly.
Difference between the graphs 
The histogram calculations were the most interesting.
I liked going over the graphs more
I liked that we got to work with our groups on the infividual assignments
 The usefulness of histograms is great.

 The clarification on what type of graph to make for each type of data
 I found interesting the section in which we were shown which chart is best for different data.
 I found the way histograms are able to fit data points into bins interesting.
 I found it interesting to see how many different graphs would work for a set of data
 The flow chart showing which chart to use depending on the type of data being presented. 
 I found it interesting that time can be both continuous or discrete data depending on the context it is used in. For example, in the bike problem, the time is seen as discrete, as bike usage is recorded at certain hours of the day and cannot be determined for any times in between these. 
 The helpfulness of histograms and their ability to display data
 I think the practice with histograms was really important because it cleared up a lot of my confusion and I feel like I understand it much better now.

 Histograms and line charts can both be used to show patterns in data where the data are, for example, the total number of bikers during each hour of the day. 
 I found the graph review most interesting. I liked how many graphs would fit a certain scenario, but ones fit better than others, and this was explained in the lecture today. I also thought it was important that the histograms were reviewed. I also thought it was important that the due dates are posted sometime in the class period, either at the beginning or end. 
 I enjoyed analyzing the data for the CoGo bike share users to determine periods of low usage. It was interesting to interpret this data.
 The things that can be shown with a histogram was very interesting. I found it cool that so many things can be gathered with this simple chart.

I found that the group time was very helpful because I learned how to make histograms on excel and change the boxes
histograms.
I think the review of graphs was very interesting as it helped clarify the differences between them. I definitely used the wrong graphs for the previous assignments due today, but this class helped clarify the differences.
How to create a histogram.
I liked learning about finding out how to graph different variables. I also found how the histograms and the use of the statistics function useful.
What I found most interesting in today's class was the implementation of examples to give students a more broad demonstration of histograms.

 I think the practice with histograms was really important because it cleared up a lot of my confusion and I feel like I understand it much better now.
 I found making histograms to be most interesting. 
 What i found most interesting in todays class was picking the chart types. I found myself struggling with that in the activities so practicing with graph types and data was helpful and interesting to me.
 Histograms and line charts can both be used to show patterns in data where the data are, for example, the total number of bikers during each hour of the day. 
 I found the graph review most interesting. I liked how many graphs would fit a certain scenario, but ones fit better than others, and this was explained in the lecture today. I also thought it was important that the histograms were reviewed. I also thought it was important that the due dates are posted sometime in the class period, either at the beginning or end. 
 I enjoyed analyzing the data for the CoGo bike share users to determine periods of low usage. It was interesting to interpret this data.
 The things that can be shown with a histogram was very interesting. I found it cool that so many things can be gathered with this simple chart.
 Learning about histograms
 I really enjoyed learning about histograms and how to implement them and how they organize data. 
 I enjoyed learning the different ways in which histograms are made. Also the career exploration seems interesting.
 There were many different options for making graphs and changing the formatting.
 The cool histograms were pretty awesome to see. Looking at the different visualizations is nice.
 I found the various uses of histograms to be the most compelling part of today's class. I had never thought about the various ways you could use histograms.
 The histogram plotting and the activity A07
 I thought working thought making histograms was very useful. Online classes can make this type of learning hard through videos but walkthroughs are much more beneficial.
 I found most interesting how to calculate for bins and range. 
 The most interesting thing about class today was learning about how to use histograms, and when the best times to use a histogram are (like what the best data for a histogram is).
 Continued use of Excel has interested me because I never knew just how useful it was with interpreting data.
 I found the assignment 07 was the most interesting because it's helping me understand how to use excel. Excel is tricky for first time users but I'm starting to get the hang of it
 I thought the way to create histograms was most interesting because it's cool to see how data shakes out.

 I found most interesting how to calculate for bins and range. 
 The most interesting thing about class today was learning about how to use histograms, and when the best times to use a histogram are (like what the best data for a histogram is).
 Continued use of Excel has interested me because I never knew just how useful it was with interpreting data.
 I found the assignment 07 was the most interesting because it’s helping me understand how to use excel. Excel is tricky for first time users but I’m starting to get the hang of it
 I thought the way to create histograms was most interesting because it’s cool to see how data shakes out. 
 I like how the histograms works and implementing them sounds very useful when analyzing data.
 Test
 I found the histogram information interesting as they are a type of table I don’t often use.
 Creating histograms and modifying them to make them more useful
 I found how you can draw certain conclusions from histograms interesting. 
 The use of histograms as a potential replacement of a line graph in order to represent some data more effectively 
 Talking about how to create a histogram in excel because excel can be confusing to work with so this was really helpful. I was a little confused on assignment 7 so that was a good overview of what to do.
 How much I was able to get done during the class period, we just kept wasting time and I made progress on 3B
 The most interesting thing Is probably the guide for mac user, which is extremely helpful 
 What I found most interesting from this class was how histograms can be used to analyze data.
 The introduction to histograms and how to use them was pretty interesting. It will be a helpful tool in the future. 
 I found the used of different graphs and what situations were best to uses what graphs interesting. 
 I found it interesting learning how to represent different data with different charts
 Learning more about my breakout group
 The use of excel to create histograms and other charts.
 The most interesting part of class was learning another type of visual representation of data through the histogram. 
 The most interesting thing I got from today’s class were the chart type flow charts and getting the general outline of the quiz
 using different graphs for different data sets
 Learning to use various charts in different contexts.
 I enjoyed learning about how to make histograms in excel for the most part, excluding the bit that lacked explanation that I mentioned earlier
 I found the histograms the most interesting today. Earlier in the A03 assignment I was having trouble figuring out how charts worked and making intervals, so learning about bins was really helpful.
 The information about which plots are best used for which questions.
 Learning how to make histograms one excel. Working in breakout rooms.
 I like the part where we can engage with class. More of that would be nice as well as the polls you did before.
 I liked that we were starting to get a bit more into statistics and excel, both are used heavily in chemical engineering
 I found the idea that Excell can process so much data and give relevant graphics out of it interesting today. 
 I found it interesting how to use a histogram 
 I enjoyed working with the in-class activity for today because it helped me understand the creation of graphs in Microsoft Excell.
 I am really enjoying group work and I find it very easy to communicate and engage with my team. We help each other whenever something is confusing and I’m happy that I got grouped with them!
 how histograms could be applied to summarize data sets and their associated distributions.
 Today we got to review histograms and check in with our group members about our project. The new project seems exciting and fun to do
 The in class activity 
 I found that the group time was very helpful because I learned how to make histograms on excel and change the boxes
 histograms. 
 I think the review of graphs was very interesting as it helped clarify the differences between them. I definitely used the wrong graphs for the previous assignments due today, but this class helped clarify the differences. 
 How to create a histogram. 
 I liked learning about finding out how to graph different variables. I also found how the histograms and the use of the statistics function useful. 
 What I found most interesting in today’s class was the implementation of examples to give students a more broad demonstration of histograms. I found it interesting how changing the type of data could completely change whether or not a certain graph was the better choice to use.","In today's lecture, students were most interested in histograms, including how to make and utilize them and some of their general properties. Students also enjoyed learning about what charts to use to represent different variables and data types the best. Additionally, students liked working with their groups and interacting with the class in general. Furthermore, students found the in-class activity (assignment 7) very helpful. Finally, students felt that they were getting better at using Excel, and class helped clarify some of their problems.",I really enjoyed learning about histograms and how to implement them and how they organize data.

Using excel learning histograms
The part I found most interesting in today's class was how well histograms display the distribution of data.
The web chart explaining what charts we can use in excel depending on what information we have been given.
It was interesting in today's class to learn about how to create histograms in excel and how to format them properly.
Difference between the graphs
The histogram calculations were the most interesting.
I liked going over the graphs more
I liked that we got to work with our groups on the infividual assignments
The usefulness of histograms is great.
i found the histogram and the A07 interesting to figure out
The clarification on what type of graph to make for each type of data
I found interesting the section in which we were shown which chart is best for different data.
I found the way histograms are able to fit data points into bins interesting.
I found it interesting to see how many different graphs would work for a set of data
The flow chart showing which chart to use depending on the type of data being presented.
I found it interesting that time can be both continuous or discrete data depending on the context it is used in. For example, in the bike problem, the time is seen as discrete, as bike usage is recorded at certain hours of the day and cannot be determined for any times in between these.
The helpfulness of histograms and their ability to display data
I think the practice with histograms was really important because it cleared up a lot of my confusion and I feel like I understand it much better now.
I found making histograms to be most interesting.
What i found most interesting in todays class was picking the chart types. I found myself struggling with that in the activities so practicing with graph types and data was helpful and interesting to me.
Histograms and line charts can both be used to show patterns in data where the data are, for example, the total number of bikers during each hour of the day.
I found the graph review most interesting. I liked how many graphs would fit a certain scenario, but ones fit better than others, and this was explained in the lecture today. I also thought it was important that the histograms were reviewed. I also thought it was important that the due dates are posted sometime in the class period, either at the beginning or end.
I enjoyed analyzing the data for the CoGo bike share users to determine periods of low usage. It was interesting to interpret this data.
The things that can be shown with a histogram was very interesting. I found it cool that so many things can be gathered with this simple chart.
Learning about histograms
I really enjoyed learning about histograms and how to implement them and how they organize data.
I enjoyed learning the different ways in which histograms are made. Also the career exploration seems interesting.
There were many different options for making graphs and changing the formatting.
The cool histograms were pretty awesome to see. Looking at the different visualizations is nice.
I found the various uses of histograms to be the most compelling part of today's class. I had never thought about the various ways you could use histograms.
The histogram plotting and the activity A07
I thought working thought making histograms was very useful. Online classes can make this type of learning hard through videos but walkthroughs are much more beneficial.
I found most interesting how to calculate for bins and range.
The most interesting thing about class today was learning about how to use histograms, and when the best times to use a histogram are (like what the best data for a histogram is).
Continued use of Excel has interested me because I never knew just how useful it was with interpreting data.
I found the assignment 07 was the most interesting because it's helping me understand how to use excel. Excel is tricky for first time users but I'm starting to get the hang of it
I thought the way to create histograms was most interesting because it's cool to see how data shakes out.
I like how the histograms works and implementing them sounds very useful when analyzing data.
I found the histogram information interesting as they are a type of table I don't often use.
Creating histograms and modifying them to make them more useful
I found how you can draw certain conclusions from histograms interesting.
The use of histograms as a potential replacement of a line graph in order to represent some data more effectively
Talking about how to create a histogram in excel because excel can be confusing to work with so this was really helpful. I was a little confused on assignment 7 so that was a good overview of what to do.
How much I was able to get done during the class period, we just kept wasting time and I made progress on 3B
The most interesting thing Is probably the guide for mac user, which is extremely helpful
What I found most interesting from this class was how histograms can be used to analyze data.
The introduction to histograms and how to use them was pretty interesting. It will be a helpful tool in the future.
I found the used of different graphs and what situations were best to uses what graphs interesting.
I found it interesting learning how to represent different data with different charts
Learning more about my breakout group
The use of excel to create histograms and other charts.
The most interesting part of class was learning another type of visual representation of data through the histogram.
The most interesting thing I got from today's class were the chart type flow charts and getting the general outline of the quiz
using different graphs for different data sets
Learning to use various charts in different contexts.
I enjoyed learning about how to make histograms in excel for the most part, excluding the bit that lacked explanation that I mentioned earlier
I found the histograms the most interesting today. Earlier in the A03 assignment I was having trouble figuring out how charts worked and making intervals, so learning about bins was really helpful.

The flow chart showing which chart to use depending on the type of data being presented. -> 4
I found it interesting that time can be both continuous or discrete data depending on the context it is used in. For example, in the bike problem, the time is seen as discrete, as bike usage is recorded at certain hours of the day and cannot be determined for any times in between these. -> 3
The helpfulness of histograms and their ability to display data -> 3
I think the practice with histograms was really important because it cleared up a lot of my confusion and I feel like I understand it much better now. -> 4

I found the graph review most interesting. I liked how many graphs would fit a certain scenario, but ones fit better than others, and this was explained in the lecture today. I also thought it was important that the histograms were reviewed. I also thought it was important that the due dates are posted sometime in the class period, either at the beginning or end. -> 3
I enjoyed analyzing the data for the CoGo bike share users to determine periods of low usage. It was interesting to interpret this data. -> 1

using different graphs for different data sets -> 3
Learning to use various charts in different contexts. -> 2
I enjoyed learning about how to make histograms in excel for the most part, excluding the bit that lacked explanation that I mentioned earlier -> 4
I found the histograms the most interesting today. Earlier in the A03 assignment I was having trouble figuring out how charts worked and making intervals, so learning about bins was really helpful. -> 3
The information about which plots are best used for which questions. -> 3
Learning how to make histograms one excel. Working in breakout rooms. -> 3

Using excel learning histograms
The part I found most interesting in today’s class was how well histograms display the distribution of data.
The web chart explaining what charts we can use in excel depending on what information we have been given.
It was interesting in today’s class to learn about how to create histograms in excel and how to format them properly.
Difference between the graphs
The histogram calculations were the most interesting.
I liked going over the graphs more
I liked that we got to work with our groups on the infividual assignments
The usefulness of histograms is great.
i found the histogram and the A07 interesting to figure out
The clarification on what type of graph to make for each type of data
I found interesting the section in which we were shown which chart is best for different data.
I found the way histograms are able to fit data points into bins interesting.
I found it interesting to see how many different graphs would work for a set of data
The flow chart showing which chart to use depending on the type of data being presented.
I found it interesting that time can be both continuous or discrete data depending on the context it is used in. For example, in the bike problem, the time is seen as discrete, as bike usage is recorded at certain hours of the day and cannot be determined for any times in between these.
The helpfulness of histograms and their ability to display data
I think the practice with histograms was really important because it cleared up a lot of my confusion and I feel like I understand it much better now.
I found making histograms to be most interesting.
What i found most interesting in todays class was picking the chart types. I found myself struggling with that in the activities so practicing with graph types and data was helpful and interesting to me.
Histograms and line charts can both be used to show patterns in data where the data are, for example, the total number of bikers during each hour of the day.
I found the graph review most interesting. I liked how many graphs would fit a certain scenario, but ones fit better than others, and this was explained in the lecture today. I also thought it was important that the histograms were reviewed. I also thought it was important that the due dates are posted sometime in the class period, either at the beginning or end.
I enjoyed analyzing the data for the CoGo bike share users to determine periods of low usage. It was interesting to interpret this data.
The things that can be shown with a histogram was very interesting. I found it cool that so many things can be gathered with this simple chart.
Learning about histograms
I really enjoyed learning about histograms and how to implement them and how they organize data.
I enjoyed learning the different ways in which histograms are made. Also the career exploration seems interesting.
There were many different options for making graphs and changing the formatting.
The cool histograms were pretty awesome to see. Looking at the different visualizations is nice.
I found the various uses of histograms to be the most compelling part of today’s class. I had never thought about the various ways you could use histograms.
The histogram plotting and the activity A07
I thought working thought making histograms was very useful. Online classes can make this type of learning hard through videos but walkthroughs are much more beneficial.
I found most interesting how to calculate for bins and range.
The most interesting thing about class today was learning about how to use histograms, and when the best times to use a histogram are (like what the best data for a histogram is).
Continued use of Excel has interested me because I never knew just how useful it was with interpreting data.
I found the assignment 07 was the most interesting because it’s helping me understand how to use excel. Excel is tricky for first time users but I’m starting to get the hang of it
I thought the way to create histograms was most interesting because it’s cool to see how data shakes out.
I like how the histograms works and implementing them sounds very useful when analyzing data.
Test
I found the histogram information interesting as they are a type of table I don’t often use.
Creating histograms and modifying them to make them more useful
I found how you can draw certain conclusions from histograms interesting.
The use of histograms as a potential replacement of a line graph in order to represent some data more effectively
Talking about how to create a histogram in excel because excel can be confusing to work with so this was really helpful. I was a little confused on assignment 7 so that was a good overview of what to do.
How much I was able to get done during the class period, we just kept wasting time and I made progress on 3B
The most interesting thing Is probably the guide for mac user, which is extremely helpful
What I found most interesting from this class was how histograms can be used to analyze data.
The introduction to histograms and how to use them was pretty interesting. It will be a helpful tool in the future.

We got a lot done. 
I really like statistics so I love learning about data distribution and skew and what changes how a group of data presents itself. 
Using excel learning histograms
The part I found most interesting in today’s class was how well histograms display the distribution of data. 
The web chart explaining what charts we can use in excel depending on what information we have been given.
It was interesting in today’s class to learn about how to create histograms in excel and how to format them properly.
Difference between the graphs 
The histogram calculations were the most interesting.
I liked going over the graphs more
I liked that we got to work with our groups on the infividual assignments
 The usefulness of histograms is great.
 i found the histogram and the A07 interesting to figure out
 The clarification on what type of graph to make for each type of data
 I found interesting the section in which we were shown which chart is best for different data.
 I found the way histograms are able to fit data points into bins interesting.
 I found it interesting to see how many different graphs would work for a set of data
 The flow chart showing which chart to use depending on the type of data being presented. 
 I found it interesting that time can be both continuous or discrete data depending on the context it is used in. For example, in the bike problem, the time is seen as discrete, as bike usage is recorded at certain hours of the day and cannot be determined for any times in between these. 
 The helpfulness of histograms and their ability to display data
 I think the practice with histograms was really important because it cleared up a lot of my confusion and I feel like I understand it much better now.
 I found making histograms to be most interesting. 
 What i found most interesting in todays class was picking the chart types. I found myself struggling with that in the activities so practicing with graph types and data was helpful and interesting to me.
 Histograms and line charts can both be used to show patterns in data where the data are, for example, the total number of bikers during each hour of the day. 
 I found the graph review most interesting. I liked how many graphs would fit a certain scenario, but ones fit better than others, and this was explained in the lecture today. I also thought it was important that the histograms were reviewed. I also thought it was important that the due dates are posted sometime in the class period, either at the beginning or end. 
 I enjoyed analyzing the data for the CoGo bike share users to determine periods of low usage. It was interesting to interpret this data.
 The things that can be shown with a histogram was very interesting. I found it cool that so many things can be gathered with this simple chart.
 Learning about histograms
 I really enjoyed learning about histograms and how to implement them and how they organize data. 
 I enjoyed learning the different ways in which histograms are made. Also the career exploration seems interesting.
 There were many different options for making graphs and changing the formatting.
 The cool histograms were pretty awesome to see. Looking at the different visualizations is nice.
 I found the various uses of histograms to be the most compelling part of today’s class. I had never thought about the various ways you could use histograms.
 The histogram plotting and the activity A07
 I thought working thought making histograms was very useful. Online classes can make this type of learning hard through videos but walkthroughs are much more beneficial.
 I found most interesting how to calculate for bins and range. 
 The most interesting thing about class today was learning about how to use histograms, and when the best times to use a histogram are (like what the best data for a histogram is).
 Continued use of Excel has interested me because I never knew just how useful it was with interpreting data.
 I found the assignment 07 was the most interesting because it’s helping me understand how to use excel. Excel is tricky for first time users but I’m starting to get the hang of it
 I thought the way to create histograms was most interesting because it’s cool to see how data shakes out. 
 I like how the histograms works and implementing them sounds very useful when analyzing data.
 Test
 I found the histogram information interesting as they are a type of table I don’t often use.
 Creating histograms and modifying them to make them more useful
 I found how you can draw certain conclusions from histograms interesting. 
 The use of histograms as a potential replacement of a line graph in order to represent some data more effectively 
 Talking about how to create a histogram in excel because excel can be confusing to work with so this was really helpful. I was a little confused on assignment 7 so that was a good overview of what to do.
 How much I was able to get done during the class period, we just kept wasting time and I made progress on 3B
 The most interesting thing Is probably the guide for mac user, which is extremely helpful 
 What I found most interesting from this class was how histograms can be used to analyze data.
 The introduction to histograms and how to use them was pretty interesting. It will be a helpful tool in the future. 
 I found the used of different graphs and what situations were best to uses what graphs interesting. 
 I found it interesting learning how to represent different data with different charts
 Learning more about my breakout group
 The use of excel to create histograms and other charts.
 The most interesting part of class was learning another type of visual representation of data through the histogram. 
 The most interesting thing I got from today’s class were the chart type flow charts and getting the general outline of the quiz
 using different graphs for different data sets
 Learning to use various charts in different contexts.
 I enjoyed learning about how to make histograms in excel for the most part, excluding the bit that lacked explanation that I mentioned earlier
 I found the histograms the most interesting today. Earlier in the A03 assignment I was having trouble figuring out how charts worked and making intervals, so learning about bins was really helpful.
 The information about which plots are best used for which questions.
 Learning how to make histograms one excel. Working in breakout rooms.
 I like the part where we can engage with class. More of that would be nice as well as the polls you did before.
 I liked that we were starting to get a bit more into statistics and excel, both are used heavily in chemical engineering
 I found the idea that Excell can process so much data and give relevant graphics out of it interesting today. 
 I found it interesting how to use a histogram 
 I enjoyed working with the in-class activity for today because it helped me understand the creation of graphs in Microsoft Excell.
 I am really enjoying group work and I find it very easy to communicate and engage with my team. We help each other whenever something is confusing and I’m happy that I got grouped with them!
 how histograms could be applied to summarize data sets and their associated distributions.
 Today we got to review histograms and check in with our group members about our project. The new project seems exciting and fun to do
 The in class activity 
 I found that the group time was very helpful because I learned how to make histograms on excel and change the boxes
 histograms. 
 I think the review of graphs was very interesting as it helped clarify the differences between them. I definitely used the wrong graphs for the previous assignments due today, but this class helped clarify the differences. 
 How to create a histogram. 
 I liked learning about finding out how to graph different variables. I also found how the histograms and the use of the statistics function useful. 
 What I found most interesting in today’s class was the implementation of examples to give students a more broad demonstration of histograms. I found it interesting how changing the type of data could completely change whether or not a certain graph was the better choice to use.",I really enjoyed learning about histograms and how to implement them and how they organize data.

The thing that I found most interesting was the just the projects in general. Studio time was interesting and I find it interesting how the team is starting to feel more comfortable with each other.
The statistics.
It was interesting to learn more about histograms and how they can be used
As always I like when we can participate even with polls or talking in class.
How extensively a histogram can be used- I originally believed it was an equivalent to a bar chart but with histograms we can do a variety of calculations and interpretations which was very interesting since I never expected it.
How much data excel can handle so quickly
I found finding the z score very interesting
The normal curve was interesting to me because of the empirical rule which showed the percentages ofbthe data covered by each standard deviation of the curve.
Like the previous classes, I love talking to my group and making sure everyone knows what their responsibilities are!!
zscore and how it can be used to find probability and such
We were able to count skittles as a little activity and I feel like that was the most interesting thing this class
I liked the idea of including us into counting the skittles to formulate our data however I didn't see how it connected to the rest of class because we didn't use it at all
I found it interesting to work on assignment 5 with my team and discuss our ideas for recommendations
Learning how to use the z score and putting it in practice
I found finding the probability using the histograms really interesting. It's helpful to know that the x axis in histograms can be changed to percentages to better interpret the data.
How powerful the excel can do.
I found it interesting to see z-scores, which i already knew about as i took ap Statistics during my senior year in high school. I also thought that finding out about the myu and standard deviation was fun to learn about.
What I found most interesting in today's class was the differences between using histograms with less frequencies for the probability and how that differs from using the normalized method or a graph with a higher number of frequencies.","I enjoyed discussing z scores and how they can be used to calculate probability. This is a very useful and practical skill that can be applied in many ways. It is nice to have a class which goes over how to use them and apply them.

Learning about z scores and how mean and standard deviation relate
What I found interesting about today's class was how easy probability can be calculated when looking at a normal histogram. 
I found the usefulness of z-scores interesting and how they work.
Today I enjoyed learning about the z scores and probability because statistics was always interesting to me in high school and I enjoy learning about it.
I found that being able to convert any sort of distribution to a normal distribution was interesting.

Calculating z values 
The fact that our data is used for next class is pretty interesting because we the students are part of the data we work with.
Going over the due dates for the upcoming assignments 
 I liked the addition of probability, the normal curve and z scores to our class. I feel that is going to be helpful in the future.
 The z scores and probability was well explained especially with the little bit of new material.
 i found it interesting to work in breakout rooms and talk to my teammates.
 I found interesting the application of real life products like skittles to probability and standard distribution.
 I really like the Skittles assignment.
 The different data that we were using to do the skittles project 
 How a normal curve in a histogram can be transformed into a frequency percentage
 z-scores can help to find probability of certain events. 
 The use of z-scores
 Skittle activity was fun to do.
 I really liked the breakout rooms because it felt like my group accomplished a lot and asked questions when needed. I also felt like the Z score information was helpful because it cleared up some confusion from the “complete before class” module.
 I found the time spent working with my group and getting to know them better was most interesting. 
 I found it interesting how the normal distribution and the standard deviation/z score can be used to find the probability of certain events occurring. 
 I found the idea of finding probability through z scores very interesting. I am not used to working with histograms and enjoy the many benefits of using them over a regular chart. 
 I enjoyed learning about standardization as it seems like it will be very useful in interpreting data and calculating probability. It was also fun to solve the skittles problem using this new method.
 The connection of probability and histograms was very interesting to me.
 Skittles are weird
 The z data as well as the chart of percentages was interesting and seems like a very useful tool.
 I really enjoyed learning about Z scores and probability. I liked how you showed us how we can use probability to find interesting statistics. 
 Today's assignment 8 was very interesting and easy to understand. 
 The application of z scores was interesting to see how it is used to create predictions and see trends
 using Z score chart was the most interesting
 I found the skittles to be a fun and interesting example of how to use our skills to actually do something.
 I learned more about the applications of Z-score and the breakdown of how it is used. 
 I thought that the z-score was the most interesting part, considering the table seems very easy and straightforward to use.
 Histogram uses in excel
 The most interesting part of today's class was learning about the probability aspects of a histogram and everything about z scores and stuff.
 I found the z table most interesting because it's on easy way to find z value from data.
 What was interesting in today's class was learning some more about z values
 I thought it was interesting to try and learn real world applications of the statistical concepts we were learning. 
 Today most interesting thing that I found was working together with my team and start doing assignments together. 
 The z-product stuff was interesting to me because it incorporates math in a sense with area under a curve.
 using z scores and normal curves to figure out probabilities
 I found the histogram data interpretation interesting.
 The most interesting aspect of today's class was defiantly learning the ability to compute the z-score. I think this will be a very valuable resource
 It was interesting how we can use the bell curve graphs to talk about probability. 
 Remembering how to do Z-scores
 Everything else was Interesting 
 One topic I found most interesting from today's class was how histograms can be used for probability. 
 The most interesting thing today was in relation to standard deviation table. 
 I found how to find the probability of skittles interesting and that we have assignment 5 due Wednesday very interesting! 
 The breakout rooms were good
 I actually find the excel histograms very interesting!
 I found the z scores way of analyzing the chart area interesting with its calculus. 
 I found how we can use histograms and z-scores to determine the probability of certain things happening in data sets

 I really like the Skittles assignment.
 The different data that we were using to do the skittles project 
 How a normal curve in a histogram can be transformed into a frequency percentage
 z-scores can help to find probability of certain events. 
 The use of z-scores
 Skittle activity was fun to do.
 I really liked the breakout rooms because it felt like my group accomplished a lot and asked questions when needed. I also felt like the Z score information was helpful because it cleared up some confusion from the “complete before class” module.
 I found the time spent working with my group and getting to know them better was most interesting. 
 I found it interesting how the normal distribution and the standard deviation/z score can be used to find the probability of certain events occurring. 
 I found the idea of finding probability through z scores very interesting. I am not used to working with histograms and enjoy the many benefits of using them over a regular chart. 
 I enjoyed learning about standardization as it seems like it will be very useful in interpreting data and calculating probability. It was also fun to solve the skittles problem using this new method.
 The connection of probability and histograms was very interesting to me.
 Skittles are weird
 The z data as well as the chart of percentages was interesting and seems like a very useful tool.
 I really enjoyed learning about Z scores and probability. I liked how you showed us how we can use probability to find interesting statistics. 
 Today’s assignment 8 was very interesting and easy to understand. 
 The application of z scores was interesting to see how it is used to create predictions and see trends
 using Z score chart was the most interesting
 I found the skittles to be a fun and interesting example of how to use our skills to actually do something.
 I learned more about the applications of Z-score and the breakdown of how it is used. 
 I thought that the z-score was the most interesting part, considering the table seems very easy and straightforward to use.
 Histogram uses in excel
 The most interesting part of today’s class was learning about the probability aspects of a histogram and everything about z scores and stuff.
 I found the z table most interesting because it’s on easy way to find z value from data.
 What was interesting in today’s class was learning some more about z values
 I thought it was interesting to try and learn real world applications of the statistical concepts we were learning. 
 Today most interesting thing that I found was working together with my team and start doing assignments together. 
 The z-product stuff was interesting to me because it incorporates math in a sense with area under a curve.
 using z scores and normal curves to figure out probabilities
 I found the histogram data interpretation interesting.
 The most interesting aspect of today’s class was defiantly learning the ability to compute the z-score. I think this will be a very valuable resource
 It was interesting how we can use the bell curve graphs to talk about probability. 
 Remembering how to do Z-scores
 Everything else was Interesting 
 One topic I found most interesting from today’s class was how histograms can be used for probability. 
 The most interesting thing today was in relation to standard deviation table. 
 I found how to find the probability of skittles interesting and that we have assignment 5 due Wednesday very interesting! 
 The breakout rooms were good
 I actually find the excel histograms very interesting!
 I found the z scores way of analyzing the chart area interesting with its calculus. 
 I found how we can use histograms and z-scores to determine the probability of certain things happening in data sets 
 The fact that you can use histograms to solve probability problems.
 The function of the z-score
 I enjoyed learning how to input data in a team.
 I enjoyed working with my group to complete the assignments because we got to work together and finish the work as a group
 The thing that I found most interesting was the just the projects in general. Studio time was interesting and I find it interesting how the team is starting to feel more comfortable with each other.
 The statistics.
 It was interesting to learn more about histograms and how they can be used
 As always I like when we can participate even with polls or talking in class. 
 How extensively a histogram can be used- I originally believed it was an equivalent to a bar chart but with histograms we can do a variety of calculations and interpretations which was very interesting since I never expected it. 
 How much data excel can handle so quickly
 I found finding the z score very interesting
 The normal curve was interesting to me because of the empirical rule which showed the percentages ofbthe data covered by each standard deviation of the curve.
 Like the previous classes, I love talking to my group and making sure everyone knows what their responsibilities are!!
 zscore and how it can be used to find probability and such
 We were able to count skittles as a little activity and I feel like that was the most interesting thing this class
 I liked the idea of including us into counting the skittles to formulate our data however I didn’t see how it connected to the rest of class because we didn’t use it at all 
 I found it interesting to work on assignment 5 with my team and discuss our ideas for recommendations
 Learning how to use the z score and putting it in practice 
 I found finding the probability using the histograms really interesting. It’s helpful to know that the x axis in histograms can be changed to percentages to better interpret the data.
 How powerful the excel can do. 
 I found it interesting to see z-scores, which i already knew about as i took ap Statistics during my senior year in high school. I also thought that finding out about the myu and standard deviation was fun to learn about. 
 What I found most interesting in today’s class was the differences between using histograms with less frequencies for the probability and how that differs from using the normalized method or a graph with a higher number of frequencies.","In this lecture, students were most interested in learning about z-scores, especially the z-score chart. Students were also interested in how to find probabilities using z-scores, histograms, or from real data. Additionally, students enjoyed the Skittles assignmenet and getting to apply concepts to real data. Furthermore, students liked time spent working in teams. Finally, students were interested in how to normalize/standardize data, uses of normalized data, and how to convert this data back to frequencies.",I enjoyed discussing z scores and how they can be used to calculate probability.

The thing that I found most interesting was the just the projects in general. Studio time was interesting and I find it interesting how the team is starting to feel more comfortable with each other.
The statistics.
It was interesting to learn more about histograms and how they can be used
As always I like when we can participate even with polls or talking in class.
How extensively a histogram can be used- I originally believed it was an equivalent to a bar chart but with histograms we can do a variety of calculations and interpretations which was very interesting since I never expected it.
How much data excel can handle so quickly
I found finding the z score very interesting
The normal curve was interesting to me because of the empirical rule which showed the percentages ofbthe data covered by each standard deviation of the curve.
Like the previous classes, I love talking to my group and making sure everyone knows what their responsibilities are!!
zscore and how it can be used to find probability and such
We were able to count skittles as a little activity and I feel like that was the most interesting thing this class
I liked the idea of including us into counting the skittles to formulate our data however I didn’t see how it connected to the rest of class because we didn’t use it at all
I found it interesting to work on assignment 5 with my team and discuss our ideas for recommendations
Learning how to use the z score and putting it in practice
I found finding the probability using the histograms really interesting. It’s helpful to know that the x axis in histograms can be changed to percentages to better interpret the data.
How powerful the excel can do.
I found it interesting to see z-scores, which i already knew about as i took ap Statistics during my senior year in high school. I also thought that finding out about the myu and standard deviation was fun to learn about.
What I found most interesting in today’s class was the differences between using histograms with less frequencies for the probability and how that differs from using the normalized method or a graph with a higher number of frequencies.","I enjoyed discussing z scores and how they can be used to calculate probability. This is a very useful and practical skill that can be applied in many ways. It is nice to have a class which goes over how to use them and apply them.

 I found finding the probability using the histograms really interesting. It’s helpful to know that the x axis in histograms can be changed to percentages to better interpret the data.
 How powerful the excel can do. 
 I found it interesting to see z-scores, which i already knew about as i took ap Statistics during my senior year in high school. I also thought that finding out about the myu and standard deviation was fun to learn about. 
 What I found most interesting in today’s class was the differences between using histograms with less frequencies for the probability and how that differs from using the normalized method or a graph with a higher number of frequencies.",I enjoyed discussing z scores and how they can be used to calculate probability. This is a very useful and practical skill that can be applied in many ways. It is nice to have a class which goes over how to use them and apply them. I really liked the breakout rooms because it felt like my group accomplished a lot and asked questions when needed. I also felt like the Z score information was helpful because it cleared up some confusion from the “complete before class” module. I found the idea of finding probability through z scores very interesting. I am not used to working with histograms and enjoy the many benefits of using them over a regular chart. I found interesting the application of real life products like skittles to probability and standard distribution. I found that being able to convert any sort of distribution to a normal distribution was interesting.,"Z-scores (or z-values, z-product, z chart, z table, z data)
