0,51,51,Alex,engr131_s014-fall2020,6,Describe what was confusing or needed more details in today's class?,"Nothing was really confusing in today’s class I understood what was being taught and what we had to do. -> 1
The class made sense for the most part, but it was allitle confusing when you went over the z-tables, especually the part with calculus -> 2
I am kind of confused about the a05 assignment that the professor did not mention in class -> 1
nothing was confusing in this class because I have learned it before. -> 1
To be honest, the whole lecture was kind of hard to follow and mostly seemed to be reiterating the material from the modules. -> 2
I was not confused by anything in today’s class. I would have liked some specifications of the general content of the quiz, though. -> 1
It would have been nice to have more instruction about the in class activity, since a lot of people were confused about what we needed to do and what we needed to turn in. -> 4
The deadlines for all the assignments were confusing, and the probability was a little confusing at first -> 2
Nothing was very confusing in today’s class -> 1
Sometimes when you put us into our breakout groups your instructions are a little unclear, so it would help to clarify more or put instructions in the chat. -> 2
I didn’t find anything discussed in today’s class to be confusing. The class was developed and demonstrated in a helpful fashion and helped me obtain a better understanding of the importance of the z chart and histograms. -> 1
I understood everything in class today and enjoyed the time you gave us with our teams. The only thing i would say could be improved was there was some confusion over where the files were for the in class quiz 1. -> 3
The first breakout room when we counted skittles for 15 minutes. I didnt know what we were doing and needed more direction. -> 3
How to complete assignment 5 -> 2
Nothing has the chance to be confusing because every class is simply a rehash of the modules, with no new content. It is simply tedious. -> 1
I was not sure if I should submit anything into the class 3b participation because you said only one person in our team has to submit. -> 2
The only thing that was confusing at first was trying to figure out where to locate the data needed for the skittle assignment. -> 1
I would have liked more details on what data is used for which problems on Assignment 8. I was also confused with how to submit the in class assignment. -> 3
I found that the statistical analysis that used z was kind of confusing as it was my first time doing statistics. -> 1
I didn’t really understand the z formulas that well because class went by too quickly. -> 2
I was a little bit confused on what our in class activity was today, and wasn’t sure if all we had to turn in was the form we filled out. But I figured it out! -> 1
I feel that the standard deviation is confusing and could use another day. The concept is hard to grasp for me. -> 4
The due dates I still find the most confusing. Additionally, the z scores were a tad confusing even though I learned them in hs. More explanation on them besides the video would be helpful. -> 4
I think that the assignment A08 needed more details. I was confused about what we are supposed to be getting done. -> 3
I believe in today’s lecture they probably could’ve been a better instruction on the fact that only one person had to submit the skittles data. Therefore we would be about to do all of our assignment right away. -> 1
Understanding when it is accurate to use Z scores was confusing. This is because I was not sure how accurate a graph would fit the trend of a standard Z score graph. -> 2
I did not find anything in class today to be confusing, I thought everything was explained well and in detail. -> 1
I was confused on in assignment eight with some of the questions concerning the missing data. I was wondering if you were looking for the dates and sometimes I have a hard time working excel. -> 3
Predicting probability with z scores is very confusing even after watching the videos and lectures. I feel like it could use some more explaining so that we can better understand. -> 4
I was personally confused by the concept of standard deviations in terms of the equations used to obtain it. -> 2
z-score and how to use it -> 2
I thought everything today was pretty straightforward. One thing that was was a little confused on were the instructions for the in class activity. I do not think there was anything to turn in for participation points however the instructions were unclear on that. -> 2
I think I need to get better at understanding the formula with Z  and understanding standard deviations. -> 3
The instructions for the skittle counting activity were confusing because the data we were supposed to use was found on a different place than all the rest of the data and instructions for the activity. -> 2
The directions for the skittles activity in class were sort of confusing at first, but our team figured out what needed to be done -> 2
I was very confused when we went to our breakout rooms to insert the data for out bag of skittles. While the task was very easy, we didn’t know where to find the right bag and where to submit it. We ended up firing out there they were in separate sections of bright space. -> 3
I had trouble figuring out where to go in order to find the skittles to count to upload to the class data. If it could made more clearly in the future about where that was, that would be good. -> 4
I did not understand what the in class participation was, or what we needed to to for the skittle assignment. Finding specifically what my assignments are is challenging. -> 5
I didn’t quite fully grasp what z tables were and how do we figure out what values to use for funding the numbers -> 4
It said that there was a participation assignment but nobody knew what that was. -> 2
Not much was confusing. I understood the presentation on histograms and z-score, and it’s starting to make sense. -> 1
The in class activity we didn’t know what to submit. We put our group data in but what are we supposed to submit on brightspace. Things like this should be explained better in class -> 5
The details today were pretty clear. We were given clear instructions on what to do for the breakout rooms and due dates. -> 1
I wasn’t sure exactly what we were supposed to be working on for the second time in the breakout room. -> 3
For the most part this class period was straightforward and not confusing. More details regarding the assignment would have been helpful. -> 2
The most confusing thing today was what we were supposed to turn in after the first breakout room session. We asked for help, and figured it out. -> 4
Todays class went well. Spending more time going over the probably and how to do in on a calculator instead of using the z-score table would have been helpful and clarified the topic more. -> 3
The formulas that we went over today are somewhat confusing to me. Other than that I thought class was very good! -> 2
We didn’t discuss too much about assignment A05 I would have liked to have more information. -> 3
The data was pretty well explained in today’s class. -> 1
The z-score is still a bit confusing. I don't understand what exactly getting the score accomplishes for my data. -> 3
Nothing was especially confusing, just maybe exactly what we needed to complete in class as well as where the quiz is located in brightspace. -> 2
How to format my excel to get better grades on assignments -> 5
I did not find anything confusing in today’s class -> 1
I thought it was confusing when we are sent to break out rooms for long periods of time. -> 2
how the z scores work and are properly utilized -> 2
I was confused on what what our in class participation was for 3b. I wasn’t sure if we needed to submit anything or not. -> 4
I was a little confused for assignment A08. I wasn’t sure if we were taking sample statistics for the total amount of skittles in the bag or just yellow skittles. -> 1
This class was mostly working in breakout groups and the explanation of z-scores was good -> 1
what to do for the skittle assignment. we had a lot of extra time and were confused if we had other tasks to do -> 3
Nothing was confusing today in class. I think I’m getting a handle on histograms and probability was fairly easy as well. -> 1
I found z-scores and talking about standard deviation and area under the curve confusing. I’m not sure what it all represents and how to use those numbers to interpret data -> 3
The class 3B participation assignment was somewhat confusing as we were only supposed to have one person per team do it. And I'd like more explanation for histograms if -> 2
Which data we were supposed to count for and how to input the data -> 4
The whole z-score topic is a little confusing with the calculations and symbols used for calculation just because I haven’t really seen it before -> 3
Assignment 08 was confusing because the directions were not clear. I had my hand raised in the breakout room and no one came. -> 4
I am still a bit unsure on what we are suppose to submit for class 3B activity. -> 3
I am still confused about how to create and use histograms and the shortcuts for using excel. The normal distribution questions are also confusing. -> 4

I would have liked more details on what data is used for which problems on Assignment 8. I was also confused with how to submit the in class assignment.
Nothing has the chance to be confusing because every class is simply a rehash of the modules, with no new content. It is simply tedious.
I believe in today’s lecture they probably could’ve been a better instruction on the fact that only one person had to submit the skittles data. Therefore we would be about to do all of our assignment right away. 
The deadlines for all the assignments were confusing, and the probability was a little confusing at first
I was confused on in assignment eight with some of the questions concerning the missing data. I was wondering if you were looking for the dates and sometimes I have a hard time working excel.

Using excel is still very confusing.
what to do for the skittle assignment. we had a lot of extra time and were confused if we had other tasks to do
I found z-scores and talking about standard deviation and area under the curve confusing. I’m not sure what it all represents and how to use those numbers to interpret data
I would have liked more details on what data is used for which problems on Assignment 8. I was also confused with how to submit the in class assignment.
Nothing has the chance to be confusing because every class is simply a rehash of the modules, with no new content. It is simply tedious.
I believe in today’s lecture they probably could’ve been a better instruction on the fact that only one person had to submit the skittles data. Therefore we would be about to do all of our assignment right away. 
The deadlines for all the assignments were confusing, and the probability was a little confusing at first
I was confused on in assignment eight with some of the questions concerning the missing data. I was wondering if you were looking for the dates and sometimes I have a hard time working excel. 
To be honest, the whole lecture was kind of hard to follow and mostly seemed to be reiterating the material from the modules.
 For the most part this class period was straightforward and not confusing. More details regarding the assignment would have been helpful.
 I was a little bit confused on what our in class activity was today, and wasn’t sure if all we had to turn in was the form we filled out. But I figured it out!
 I found today’s class not confusing
 The instructions for the skittle counting activity were confusing because the data we were supposed to use was found on a different place than all the rest of the data and instructions for the activity.
 I was confused on what what our in class participation was for 3b. I wasn’t sure if we needed to submit anything or not.
 I did not find anything in class today to be confusing, I thought everything was explained well and in detail.
 I didn’t quite fully grasp what z tables were and how do we figure out what values to use for funding the numbers
 I understood everything in class today and enjoyed the time you gave us with our teams. The only thing i would say could be improved was there was some confusion over where the files were for the in class quiz 1.
 The first breakout room when we counted skittles for 15 minutes. I didnt know what we were doing and needed more direction. 
 Predicting probability with z scores is very confusing even after watching the videos and lectures. I feel like it could use some more explaining so that we can better understand.
 I thought it was confusing when we are sent to break out rooms for long periods of time.  
 how the z scores work and are properly utilized
 Nothing was really confusing in today’s class I understood what was being taught and what we had to do.
 The details today were pretty clear. We were given clear instructions on what to do for the breakout rooms and due dates.
 I had trouble figuring out where to go in order to find the skittles to count to upload to the class data. If it could made more clearly in the future about where that was, that would be good.
 I was very confused when we went to our breakout rooms to insert the data for out bag of skittles. While the task was very easy, we didn’t know where to find the right bag and where to submit it. We ended up firing out there they were in separate sections of bright space.
 The directions for the skittles activity in class were sort of confusing at first, but our team figured out what needed to be done
 How to format my excel to get better grades on assignments 
 Which data we were supposed to count for and how to input the data 
 Maybe give us a better idea of what to do when we are put in the breakout rooms because my group was a little confused during the first session because we had a lot of time to do a small amount of work.
 The class 3B participation assignment was somewhat confusing as we were only supposed to have one person per team do it. And I'd like more explanation for histograms if
 I think I need to get better at understanding the formula with Z  and understanding standard deviations.
 The only thing that was confusing at first was trying to figure out where to locate the data needed for the skittle assignment. 
 Todays class went well. Spending more time going over the probably and how to do in on a calculator instead of using the z-score table would have been helpful and clarified the topic more.
 I thought everything today was pretty straightforward. One thing that was was a little confused on were the instructions for the in class activity. I do not think there was anything to turn in for participation points however the instructions were unclear on that. 
 I did not find anything confusing in today’s class
 Nothing was very confusing in today’s class
 We didn’t discuss too much about assignment A05 I would have liked to have more information.
 Not much was confusing. I understood the presentation on histograms and z-score, and it’s starting to make sense.
 Nothing
 This class was mostly working in breakout groups and the explanation of z-scores was good
 I was personally confused by the concept of standard deviations in terms of the equations used to obtain it. 
 I was a little confused for assignment A08. I wasn’t sure if we were taking sample statistics for the total amount of skittles in the bag or just yellow skittles. 
 I am still a bit unsure on what we are suppose to submit for class 3B activity. 
 The class made sense for the most part, but it was allitle confusing when you went over the z-tables, especually the part with calculus
 Nothing was especially confusing, just maybe exactly what we needed to complete in class as well as where the quiz is located in brightspace.
 nothing 

 Sometimes when you put us into our breakout groups your instructions are a little unclear, so it would help to clarify more or put instructions in the chat.
 It would have been nice to have more instruction about the in class activity, since a lot of people were confused about what we needed to do and what we needed to turn in.
 I was not confused by anything in today’s class. I would have liked some specifications of the general content of the quiz, though.
 I found that the statistical analysis that used z was kind of confusing as it was my first time doing statistics. 
 Assignment 08 was confusing because the directions were not clear. I had my hand raised in the breakout room and no one came.
 The z-score is still a bit confusing. I don't understand what exactly getting the score accomplishes for my data.
 I was confused on what data to look at for the skittles part
 I am still confused about how to create and use histograms and the shortcuts for using excel. The normal distribution questions are also confusing. 
 Nothing was confusing 

 Nothing was confusing today in class. I think I’m getting a handle on histograms and probability was fairly easy as well.
 z-score and how to use it
 I wasn’t sure exactly what we were supposed to be working on for the second time in the breakout room. 
 I didn’t find anything discussed in today’s class to be confusing. The class was developed and demonstrated in a helpful fashion and helped me obtain a better understanding of the importance of the z chart and histograms.
 I didn’t really understand the z formulas that well because class went by too quickly.
 The in class activity we didn’t know what to submit. We put our group data in but what are we supposed to submit on brightspace. Things like this should be explained better in class
 I did not understand what the in class participation was, or what we needed to to for the skittle assignment. Finding specifically what my assignments are is challenging. 
 nothing was confusing in this class because I have learned it before.
 I feel that the standard deviation is confusing and could use another day. The concept is hard to grasp for me.
 How to complete assignment 5
 The due dates I still find the most confusing. Additionally, the z scores were a tad confusing even though I learned them in hs. More explanation on them besides the video would be helpful. 
 It said that there was a participation assignment but nobody knew what that was.
 Understanding when it is accurate to use Z scores was confusing. This is because I was not sure how accurate a graph would fit the trend of a standard Z score graph.

 The most confusing thing today was what we were supposed to turn in after the first breakout room session. We asked for help, and figured it out.
 I was not sure if I should submit anything into the class 3b participation because you said only one person in our team has to submit.
 The formulas that we went over today are somewhat confusing to me. Other than that I thought class was very good!
 I think that the assignment A08 needed more details. I was confused about what we are supposed to be getting done. 
 The whole z-score topic is a little confusing with the calculations and symbols used for calculation just because I haven’t really seen it before
 I am kind of confused about the a05 assignment that the professor did not mention in class","The directions for the skittles activity in class were sort of confusing at first, but our team figured out what needed to be done Assignment 08 was confusing because the directions were not clear.

 There wasn’t anything too confusing in today’s class, I thought it was pretty straightforward.","Most of the confusion from the lecture came from details regarding assignments, mainly Assignment 10. Many students asked for more details, feedback, or guidance regarding some of the activities they were asked to do. In addition, some students are still having issues in regards to citations and/or setting up their profiles to conduct scholarly work. There were consistent issues when it came to due dates, which ties back heavily to Assignment 10. It would be good to clarify this. Lastly, some students are still having issues with some of the equations and calculations that they were asked to do.","My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10.

 The date which assignment A10 is due was the most confusing part about the lecture today. In breakout rooms, we talked to our ta about it, and got some clarification, but my the end it was clear.
 I think that APA citing resources could have been covered more to get a better understanding of how to cite APA and where to have sources cited.
 I think that A10 needed more details. I was confused about how to complete some of the models on the assignment. 
 There wasn't anything too confusing in today's class, I thought it was pretty straightforward.","Most of the confusion from the lecture came from details regarding assignments, mainly Assignment 10. Many students asked for more details, feedback, or guidance regarding some of the activities they were asked to do. In addition, some students are still having issues in regards to citations and/or setting up their profiles to conduct scholarly work. There were consistent issues when it came to due dates, which ties back heavily to Assignment 10. It would be good to clarify this. Lastly, some students are still having issues with some of the equations and calculations that they were asked to do.","My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. |_| More feedback on our submitted work. |_| I did not understand the APA style of notation.

More feedback on our submitted work.
The different parts of A010 that were due when
I would have liked a few more details on some of the more open-ended/newer concepts and questions that we will need to figure out.
I believe that there was nothing really confusing about today’s class. Information was given really well. 
I was a little confused on how to work a part of the purdue library and google scholar. 
I’m not sure if this is in the plan for Friday, but if we could go through some of the math methods for A10 that would be great. There was nothing terribly confusing in the lecture, but it didn’t really cover the thing that I am confused by.
There was nothing confusing or unclear in today’s class. There could have been more guidance on how to answer the questions and how to format the answer.
Nothing was very confusing about the class, but I would rather have more time devoted to engineering concepts rather than research and citation making.
Due date for Assignment #10
 I was confused on when we start A11 because it said we started it today in class however I didn’t see A11 in 4A Assignments started in class and on the last slide about due dates it said A11 is due at the beginning of 5B
 My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn’t know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
 Due dates for assignment 10
 i understood everything that the professor spoke about today.
 for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
 The in class assignment was a little confusing due to lack of instructions on what kind of summary and citation you were looking for.
 How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
 This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
 I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
 I believe that we should have talked more about scholarly materials and how we can use them for information.
 The way the grading for the peer and team assessment was a little unclear. 
 I needed to see the slides that showed how to cite in spa a little longer for the in class assignment. 
 The details of what we were supposed to be working on during the studio time. The assignment is long and talked ab things I don’t think we have learned yet 
 Just more information about the project that we were supposed to work on. 
 The assignment of A10 doesn't make a lot of sense as the milestone part is somewhat confusing. 
 In today’s class I think that everything was pretty straightforward. At first I was little confused about the whole process of hydropower and reservoirs, but by the end of the class I totally understood it!
 Today’s class was pretty clear. The discussion about how reservoirs work could have been clearer to help us better understand the process of how the energy is harvested.
 I thought that everything today that was mentioned in class was pretty straightforward. There was nothing that I thought was out of the ordinary today during our lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing today.
 Lots of different due dates
 The assignments that are due was confusing and the milestone 1 and 2 weren’t talked about
 I found the information on the CATME survey to be kind of confusing. I don’t really understand what criticisms I should give my group members because I thought we all did our parts well  
 I wasn’t really confused on anything in today’s class. I think the instructions and tasks were pretty straight forward.
 Nothing, everything was adequately explained in the lecture. The only confusing thing was the original assignment explanation, but it was cleared up.
 i think the assignment 10 could have been better organized and the due dates could have been easier to find
 I would be helpful to have a little more information about how to generate relevant questions to ask clients
 How much detail is needed on these peer evaluations??
 It was confusing when you went over finding data at the start of class, you went through alot of information quickly
 Everything was straight forward I understood everything we were talking about today.
 The most confusing part of today’s lesson was figuring out which part of the technical brief was part of A10 and A12
 All of the deadlines and due dates were a little confusing, as well as the fact that only certain parts of the Taum Sauk tech brief were due.
 I thought that the part about finding information was kind of confusing because it is very difficult to find information about this reservoir that is not about the failure of it. I am confused on where to find data on the Ameren website as well.
 I found that the technical brief template was confusing as I am always unsure of exact specifics of how to format it.
 Everything was understandable.
 How to perform some of the calculations on the assignment given.
 The due dates for the new assignments were very confusing 
 The only thing that needed more details was the breakdown of assignment 10A and 10B
 I found nothing confusing. 
 Nothing needed more details. Maybe a little bit more on how to link google scholar to Purdue libraries. That would have been helpful.
 Nothing was very confusing.
 Nothing was very confusing in today’s class. As we’ve now reached the fourth week of class, I’ve adjusted to the class format and how to complete assignments 
 The class today was simple yet helpful class. I don’t think anything today was confusing. The class had a primary focus and I feel that the class hit the points that needed to be stressed.
 I am having difficulty understanding what the mathematical models mean because I couldn’t find anything that describes these models. 
 It would be nice to have a platform to ask questions durong the presentation
 The new project inteoduction was confusing but then it was better when I read the memo
 I did not understand the APA style of notation. In this class, I have gotten points taken off for having the assignment in APA. I cannot find a resource to how to make these references correctly.

Many students asked for more details, feedback, or guidance regarding some of the activities they were asked to do. In addition, some students are still having issues in regards to citations and/or setting up their profiles to conduct scholarly work. There were consistent issues when it came to due dates, which ties back heavily to Assignment 10. It would be good to clarify this. Lastly, some students are still having issues with some of the equations and calculations that they were asked to do.","My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10.

 Nothing needed more details. Maybe a little bit more on how to link google scholar to Purdue libraries. That would have been helpful.
 Nothing was very confusing.
 Nothing was very confusing in today's class. As we've now reached the fourth week of class, I've adjusted to the class format and how to complete assignments 
 The class today was simple yet helpful class. I don't think anything today was confusing. The class had a primary focus and I feel that the class hit the points that needed to be stressed.
 I am having difficulty understanding what the mathematical models mean because I couldn't find anything that describes these models. 
 It would be nice to have a platform to ask questions durong the presentation
 The new project inteoduction was confusing but then it was better when I read the memo
 I did not understand the APA style of notation. In this class, I have gotten points taken off for having the assignment in APA. I cannot find a resource to how to make these references correctly.
 the new project
 The due date of Assignment 10 and the information needed to complete it.
 The class was not confusing at all. All of the concepts that were presented were understood
 We were confused with the assignments for A10. We talked to Jeff Hall and cleared the confusion.
 The date which assignment A10 is due was the most confusing part about the lecture today. In breakout rooms, we talked to our ta about it, and got some clarification, but my the end it was clear.
 I think that APA citing resources could have been covered more to get a better understanding of how to cite APA and where to have sources cited.
 I think that A10 needed more details. I was confused about how to complete some of the models on the assignment. 
 There wasn't anything too confusing in today's class, I thought it was pretty straightforward.","In today's lecture, most students understood the content. However, many students had questions about aqssignment 10 -- when is it due and how to complete it. A few students were confused about proper citations, and some were confused about what was required for the peer assessments. Students also wanted more details about how reservoirs work. Finally, some students expressed confusion about the new project.","My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. |_| More feedback on our submitted work. |_| I did not understand the APA style of notation.

More feedback on our submitted work.
The different parts of A010 that were due when
I would have liked a few more details on some of the more open-ended/newer concepts and questions that we will need to figure out.
I believe that there was nothing really confusing about today’s class. Information was given really well. 
I was a little confused on how to work a part of the purdue library and google scholar. 
I’m not sure if this is in the plan for Friday, but if we could go through some of the math methods for A10 that would be great. There was nothing terribly confusing in the lecture, but it didn’t really cover the thing that I am confused by.
There was nothing confusing or unclear in today’s class. There could have been more guidance on how to answer the questions and how to format the answer.
Nothing was very confusing about the class, but I would rather have more time devoted to engineering concepts rather than research and citation making.
Due date for Assignment #10
 I was confused on when we start A11 because it said we started it today in class however I didn’t see A11 in 4A Assignments started in class and on the last slide about due dates it said A11 is due at the beginning of 5B
 My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn’t know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
 Due dates for assignment 10
 i understood everything that the professor spoke about today.
 for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
 The in class assignment was a little confusing due to lack of instructions on what kind of summary and citation you were looking for.
 How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
 This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
 I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
 I believe that we should have talked more about scholarly materials and how we can use them for information.
 The way the grading for the peer and team assessment was a little unclear. 
 I needed to see the slides that showed how to cite in spa a little longer for the in class assignment. 
 The details of what we were supposed to be working on during the studio time. The assignment is long and talked ab things I don’t think we have learned yet 
 Just more information about the project that we were supposed to work on. 
 The assignment of A10 doesn't make a lot of sense as the milestone part is somewhat confusing. 
 In today’s class I think that everything was pretty straightforward. At first I was little confused about the whole process of hydropower and reservoirs, but by the end of the class I totally understood it!
 Today’s class was pretty clear. The discussion about how reservoirs work could have been clearer to help us better understand the process of how the energy is harvested.
 I thought that everything today that was mentioned in class was pretty straightforward. There was nothing that I thought was out of the ordinary today during our lecture. 
 I did not find anything confusing today.
 Lots of different due dates
 The assignments that are due was confusing and the milestone 1 and 2 weren’t talked about
 I found the information on the CATME survey to be kind of confusing. I don’t really understand what criticisms I should give my group members because I thought we all did our parts well  
 I wasn’t really confused on anything in today’s class. I think the instructions and tasks were pretty straight forward.
 Nothing, everything was adequately explained in the lecture. The only confusing thing was the original assignment explanation, but it was cleared up.
 i think the assignment 10 could have been better organized and the due dates could have been easier to find
 I would be helpful to have a little more information about how to generate relevant questions to ask clients
 How much detail is needed on these peer evaluations??
 It was confusing when you went over finding data at the start of class, you went through alot of information quickly
 Everything was straight forward I understood everything we were talking about today.
 The most confusing part of today’s lesson was figuring out which part of the technical brief was part of A10 and A12
 All of the deadlines and due dates were a little confusing, as well as the fact that only certain parts of the Taum Sauk tech brief were due.
 I thought that the part about finding information was kind of confusing because it is very difficult to find information about this reservoir that is not about the failure of it. I am confused on where to find data on the Ameren website as well.
 I found that the technical brief template was confusing as I am always unsure of exact specifics of how to format it.
 Everything was understandable.
 How to perform some of the calculations on the assignment given.
 The due dates for the new assignments were very confusing 
 The only thing that needed more details was the breakdown of assignment 10A and 10B

 The ability to make and format histograms in excel is a great skill to have.
 I really liked how we got to spend a lot more time in breakout rooms because we could bounce our ideas off each other!
 Being able to identify trends in split data such as (gender) 
 Learning how to edit histograms was interesting because I have never done it before.
 I enjoy the team breakout rooms because it is easier to ask questions.
 I have been getting more and more familiar with excel but the lace is still fast enough that I’m falling behind. But with each class including this one I feel better and better using excel.
 I thought the different kinds of charts and learning how to edit them was very interesting to me. 
 When to use the different types of graphs
 i liked working with my group
 I found learning about histograms to be most interesting. 
 The inter workings of when to use a histogram because i wondered when we should use it
 I liked how we had a lot of time to work on assignment 7. Also the in class assignment was very fun to hear about everyone’s different graph types.
 The ways that are used to calculate appropriate bin size and number of bins is interesting.
 I found it interesting how we began works on an individual project with our group members.
 We get to learn about the true meaning behind a histogram
 I found taking the applications of statistics into excel interesting. I enjoyed it because I like working with statistics
 That you can edit the bins of histogram in excel, I did not previously know that. 
 I liked the long breakout room time for discussing both our class activitiy and our class assignment we started.
 The different charts that are available in excel. Also I didn’t know that macs had different versions of excel than other computers.
 I think understanding the type of graph to use based on variables was interesting 
 What I found most interesting was simply how to make histograms out of a dataset. 
 I found the group time most interesting and the constant review of the due dates. That reminder helps a lot. 
 I liked figuring out how to correctly format all histograms and included the needed characteristics for each graph. 
 I found it interesting to get a glimpse of just how many ways we can manipulate and examine specific parts of our data set
 Creating  the histograms 
 I found it interesting how easy it was to organize data into a histogram.
 Determining what graphs to use for what situations was quite interesting.
 Giving a problem and deciding which chart to use based off the variables 
 I think using excel is interesting. 
 I found discussing the different types of graphed and discussing when we should use them most helpful and interesting. I liked that this discussion was interactive.
 Excel is such a powerful tool and can evaluate data so quickly. 
 it was interesting making the histograms, it was difficult finding an underflow bin but i feel like i am getting the hang of excel
 The different types of graphs is pretty interesting. They all have different uses and having the flow chart you showed in class is very helpful and interesting. 
 histograms 
 The most interesting part of today’s class was learning about how to calculate bins and bin width and what the purpose of histograms are.
 I found it interesting how much less data you need to create a histogram.
 I found histograms and their usefulness interesting. I thought the information you could gather from them was extensive and useful.
 I found learning about histograms and how they can show frequency of data to be interesting. I see how useful they can be for data analytics. 
 The break out rooms were interesting. 
 I found it interesting how histograms display data in a way that I am not familiar with, but it a very efficient way to answer questions.
 Something important was that histograms will also be used now.
 When the quiz will be. 
 The most interesting thing was cooperating with my team members to work through assignments. 
 I thought learning to format the histograms on excel was extremely helpful. I can see myself using this tool a lot in the future.
 Histograms and how to use and manipulate them.
 I found the examples of how/when to use each type of chart was quite helpful. Knowing what chart to use when the data was continuous or discrete was particularly interesting 
 I thought the idea of histograms and the flow chart that was presented in class was the most interesting as they both made it easier to distinguish information and what types of graphs to use and when.
 I liked learning about how to format histograms because it was very interesting and will help me gather good information 
 I liked learning about how to change the histograms to make the graph look neater.
 The fact that we were given time and that when we needed help it came. I also like that the graphs are based on experments made close to campus ( the river flow of the river, etc)
 The lost jntetesting part about today was seeing how different a chart can be when we change the numer and size of bins in a historgram
 I liked using the histogram to measure frequency, which occurs often in data.
 How to develop histograms in Excel 2016
 Ways to use histograms to show data.
 I really enjoy spending time with my engineering group. They are really nice and all have the same drive as I do. Spending time is interesting since it makes up for the online class. Thanks!
 Exploring histograms and different graph types helped me understand when to us them. It was interesting  because you can use multiple graph types for data.
 I liked learning more about histograms, and how to read and create them to make data more easy to understand. I feel like this is a very useful skill.
 It was interesting that the data was able to be analyzed with more than 2 sets of data.
 I like to see how the data can compare to itself and other data sets.
 I think that it was important that we talked about the assignments that are due. The most helpful part was when my TA came to our breakout room and talked to us 
 It was interesting to learn about histograms. 
 What was interesting is the concept of in class quizzes,  because I think it is a good method of testing what I know about the subject. Also the engineering events are also interesting.
 I may say the quiz and how to take it.","I liked using the histogram to measure frequency, which occurs often in data. Excel is such a powerful tool and can evaluate data so quickly.

 I really enjoy spending time with my engineering group. They are really nice and all have the same drive as I do. Spending time is interesting since it makes up for the online class. Thanks!
 Exploring histograms and different graph types helped me understand when to us them. It was interesting  because you can use multiple graph types for data.
 I liked learning more about histograms, and how to read and create them to make data more easy to understand. I feel like this is a very useful skill.
 It was interesting that the data was able to be analyzed with more than 2 sets of data.
 I like to see how the data can compare to itself and other data sets.
 I think that it was important that we talked about the assignments that are due. The most helpful part was when my TA came to our breakout room and talked to us 
 It was interesting to learn about histograms. 
 What was interesting is the concept of in class quizzes,  because I think it is a good method of testing what I know about the subject. Also the engineering events are also interesting.
 I may say the quiz and how to take it.","when to use certain types of graphs to display various data sets (numerical vs nominal, etc.) I liked figuring out how to correctly format all histograms and included the needed characteristics for each graph. The most interesting part of today’s class was learning about how to calculate bins and bin width and what the purpose of histograms are. I enjoyed learning excel. It’s a great tool and has a high learning curve which I’m excited to get better at it. I really enjoy spending time with my engineering group. They are really nice and all have the same drive as I do. Spending time is interesting since it makes up for the online class. Thanks!","When to use different charts/graphs

 I think that the new project we are working on is very interesting. Just from doing research on the company, I can see how they have had failures and struggles, and I think it will be cool to see how we can improve upon their mistakes.
 I found it interesting when we we talked about how to better rank our team members and how to give them good feedback. 
 The most interesting part of today’s class was working with my teammates and sharing ideas with them.
 I found the idea of the assignment interesting specifically the use of excel and math to determine safety
 researching how hydropower works
 Researching the Tatum Sauk reservoir and learning how to properly answer a research question. 
 I suppose this doesn’t relate directly to the class, but the most interesting thing I learned during this meeting was that reservoirs can be essentially used as massive batteries. I had never thought of them being used to store power to be used at a later date!
 It was interesting to learn about the Taum Sauk reservoir and it’s failure in 2005. 
 the Taum Sauk Reservoir disaster
 The new team assignment  
 Taum Sauk reservoir was interesting. Especially with regards to the shape. I think it will be a fun task finding the volume.
 I found the team evaluation interesting today. 
 I found the explanation on hydroelectric power interesting.
 I found the reasons for using hydroelectric power to be interesting. I learned a lot about how it is a very viable source of energy to power things. 
 I really enjoyed the team discussion periods of the class and found the instructions very helpful.
 The mathematical models we have to do in activity 10.
 I found the concept of the project interesting.
 I enjoyed learning about hydroelectric power sources.
 Something interesting was we are evaluate and make helpful opinion to the real world power station firm.
 I found studying the reservoir very interesting. I enjoyed reading about it and hearing some of the story behind it.
 The thing that I found most interesting in today’s class was just being able to research and find out how hydropower generators work.
 The work we completed on proper sources.
 Starting a new project is very interesting to be able to learn and apply more engineering and data analysis skills.
 The building process of something so impactful as a hydroelectric dam
 I found it interesting how we can manipulate our data for the upcoming assignment and learning about the Reservoir
 I'm very interested in formulating the volume calculation for the reservoir by using the Laminar Approach.
 I really enjoyed the breakout rooms and I wish they were longer. I’m excited to start a new project and I can’t wait to learn more about engineering through these assignments. 
 I found hydroelectric power very interesting in today's class
 I think this whole project is very interesting, I really enjoy the concept of the dam and what has happened to it. And us analyzing the data to improve it 
 I found that working on assignment 10 was interesting as we were navigating a new project
 all of the different resources for trustworthy information was interesting. I didnt know there were so many places 
 Learning about and getting an introduction to hydropower and the impact of turbines. As well as learning about the upcoming assignment about. 
 the upper taum samk reservoir is a failure. 
 It was interesting to learn about hydroelectric generators, and also how the taum sauk reservoir was the biggest natural battery that existed and also how it had failed at one point due to poor building and not stopping the pump.
 The thing I found most interesting in today’s class was the video on hydroelectric power. The explanation to reinforce what we learned during the in-class activity helped me feel like I understand the groundwork for the topic.

Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class -> 1
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too? -> 3
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief. -> 4
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project. -> 3
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics. -> 1
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations. -> 3
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. -> 5
I didn’t really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. -> 3
I didn’t have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn’t completely clear to me. -> 4
i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing. -> 4
I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can’t do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. -> 3
Everything explained was clear. -> 1
I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. -> 2
I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest -> 2
Explanation for what the client memo was outlining -> 2
since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing -> 1
Something that needed more detail in today’s class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases. -> 1
The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models -> 2
 N/A -> 1
The directions for A10 weren’t as clear as they could have been, since it wasn’t noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project. -> 3
My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. -> 3
What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions. -> 1

 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today’s class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
 The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
 N/A
 The directions for A10 weren’t as clear as they could have been, since it wasn’t noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
 My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. 
 What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
 Nothing in today’s class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn’t that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I’m not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today’s class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn’t sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn’t understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn’t necessarily confused by any particular part of today’s class. 
 There wasn’t anything too particularly confusing in today’s class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn’t find anything about this lecture confusing.
 How to search for data quickly.
 The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
 What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can’t use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.

 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn’t understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn’t necessarily confused by any particular part of today’s class. 
 There wasn’t anything too particularly confusing in today’s class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn’t find anything about this lecture confusing.
 How to search for data quickly.
 The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
 What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can’t use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.

Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams.
I didn’t really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments.
I didn’t have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn’t completely clear to me.
i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can’t do parts 5-7 until 4 is done.
Everything explained was clear.
I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice.

The citation part was confusing.
A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.

 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class. 
 There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn't find anything about this lecture confusing.
 How to search for data quickly.
 The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
 What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
 Something that needed more detail in today's class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). Information on Laminar Flow and other topics that others may not know about can be explained, even if briefly, to help give a general idea of the topic to the students.","In this lecture, students were confused about how to complete assignment A10. Additionally and more specifically, students were confused by how to use the Laminar approach and how to employ mathematical models in this assignment. Similarly, students were confused about how to complete the in-class activity and what was being asked; some needed more time. Students also had questions about how to find and cite reliable sources and what sources are acceptable for use.

Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn’t really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn’t have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn’t completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can’t do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today’s class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
 The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
 N/A
 The directions for A10 weren’t as clear as they could have been, since it wasn’t noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
 My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. 
 What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
 Nothing in today’s class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn’t that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I’m not sure what that is.

What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class.

 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can’t use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
 Something that needed more detail in today’s class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). Information on Laminar Flow and other topics that others may not know about can be explained, even if briefly, to help give a general idea of the topic to the students.","Many students are confused about Assignment 10.

Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams.
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments.
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done.
Everything explained was clear.
I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice.

The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn't that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.

I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models.
I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn't necessarily confused by any particular part of today's class.
There wasn't anything too particularly confusing in today's class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.

Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class -> 1
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too? -> 3
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief. -> 4
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project. -> 3
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics. -> 1
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations. -> 3
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. -> 5
I didn’t really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. -> 3
I didn’t have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn’t completely clear to me. -> 4
i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing. -> 4
I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can’t do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. -> 3
Everything explained was clear. -> 1
I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. -> 2
I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest -> 2
Explanation for what the client memo was outlining -> 2
since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing -> 1
Something that needed more detail in today’s class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases. -> 1
The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models -> 2

The directions for A10 weren’t as clear as they could have been, since it wasn’t noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project. -> 3
My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. -> 3

Nothing in today’s class was especially confusing. -> 1
Nothing -> 1
Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected. -> 3
I am confused how the laminar approach works. -> 3

The citation part was confusing. -> 2
A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out. -> 2

I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given. -> 1
Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. -> 3
The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn’t that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was. -> 4
While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I’m not sure what that is. -> 3
Something that was confusing in today’s class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn’t sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. -> 1
I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn’t understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. -> 3
I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class. -> 3
Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand -> 4
the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it -> 3
I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn’t necessarily confused by any particular part of today’s class. -> 1
There wasn’t anything too particularly confusing in today’s class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this. -> 3
Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir. -> 2
How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades -> 5
Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing -> 4
One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations. -> 3
I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. -> 4
Nothing was confusing to me today. -> 1
Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. -> 2
I didn’t find anything about this lecture confusing. -> 1
How to search for data quickly. -> 3
The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification. -> 3
What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group? -> 2
Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment. -> 3
Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. -> 1
The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. -> 1
I didn't find anything confusing today. -> 1
It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone. -> 3
What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data -> 4
I was confused on parts of assignment A10 -> 2
I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward. -> 3
Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns. -> 2
I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right. -> 3
Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b. -> 2
I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that -> 1
nothing -> 1
What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can’t use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. -> 4
how to use the outside resources information in the research -> 1
I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment. -> 2
Something that needed more detail in today’s class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10).

What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams.
I didn’t really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments.
I didn’t have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn’t completely clear to me.

Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
I am confused how the laminar approach works.
I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
The citation part was confusing.
A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear.
The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn’t that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I’m not sure what that is.
Something that was confusing in today’s class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn’t sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat.
I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn’t understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models.
I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn’t necessarily confused by any particular part of today’s class.
There wasn’t anything too particularly confusing in today’s class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.

Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn’t really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn’t have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn’t completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can’t do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today’s class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
 The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
 N/A
 The directions for A10 weren’t as clear as they could have been, since it wasn’t noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
 My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. 
 What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
 Nothing in today’s class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn’t that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I’m not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today’s class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn’t sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn’t understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn’t necessarily confused by any particular part of today’s class. 
 There wasn’t anything too particularly confusing in today’s class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn’t find anything about this lecture confusing.
 How to search for data quickly.
 The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
 What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can’t use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
 Something that needed more detail in today’s class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). Information on Laminar Flow and other topics that others may not know about can be explained, even if briefly, to help give a general idea of the topic to the students.",Something that needed more detail in today’s class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10).

While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I'm not sure what that is.
Something that was confusing in today's class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn't sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat.
I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn't understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models.
I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.

I was confused on parts of assignment A10
I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
nothing
What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can't use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific.
how to use the outside resources information in the research
I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
Something that needed more detail in today's class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10).

What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn't really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn't have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn't completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can't do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest

I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn’t understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models.
I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn’t necessarily confused by any particular part of today’s class.
There wasn’t anything too particularly confusing in today’s class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing
One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this.
Nothing was confusing to me today.
Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources.
I didn’t find anything about this lecture confusing.
How to search for data quickly.

What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained.
The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful.
I didn't find anything confusing today.
It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
I was confused on parts of assignment A10
I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
nothing
What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can’t use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific.
how to use the outside resources information in the research
I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
Something that needed more detail in today’s class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). Information on Laminar Flow and other topics that others may not know about can be explained, even if briefly, to help give a general idea of the topic to the students.","It was all pretty clear, there wasn’t much that I was confused about in this lecture
Everything was clear over the material that was discussed in class
What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn’t really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn’t have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn’t completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can’t do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today’s class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
 The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
 N/A
 The directions for A10 weren’t as clear as they could have been, since it wasn’t noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
 My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. 
 What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
 Nothing in today’s class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn’t that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.

The Taum Sauk upper reservoir sketch for the tech brief was confusing because it did not detail  what the sketch was entailing when it came to calculations.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams. 
I didn’t really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments. 
I didn’t have enough time for the in class activity. Also what we were supposed to do in the second  time in breakout rooms wasn’t completely clear to me.
 i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing.
 I was confused because on A10 we have to split up the work but you can’t do parts 5-7 until 4 is done. 
 Everything explained was clear.
 I was somewhat confused as to if the scholarly summary needed to be a full paragraph or if 2-3 sentences could suffice. 
 I think that the documents for homework are some times confusing because the instructions are not the clearest 
 Explanation for what the client memo was outlining
 since there wasnt much info today, I didn't find anything confusing
 Something that needed more detail in today’s class was the explanation of how hydroelectric plants create greenhouse gases.
 The beginning of the assignment talking about mathematical models
 N/A
 The directions for A10 weren’t as clear as they could have been, since it wasn’t noted at the beginning that A10 was only half of the Taum Sauk Reservoir project.
 My group had some confusion figuring out exactly what needed to be done for the assignment. 
 What i felt was confusing in todays class was the premise of the in class activity. When the in class activity was assigned I was confused about what exactly needed to be completed regarding the questions.
 Nothing in today’s class was especially confusing.
 Nothing
 Mathematical models for Taum Sauk project were confusing because we didn't have enough information about what was expected.
 I am confused how the laminar approach works. 
 I was unsure as to what the mathematical models were used for and how they should be made in A10. I think if you were able to give some more overview or background of the assignment before we were sent into breakout rooms that could help
 The citation part was confusing. 
 A bit on how to calculate the volume for the resevoir, that was difficult for my team and I to figure out.
 How the catme survey worked and where it was available.
 I thought that the information about methods of finding reliable information was difficult. I would have appreciated more time being spent on it and some more examples being given.
 Nothing was confusing really everything was pretty clear. 
 The confusing part about today was figuring out how to cite my source during the in class activity. It was confusing to determine if the article that I picked out was a journal, website, excerpt, etc. The APA citation itself wasn’t that hard; just figuring out which way to cite my source was.
 While working on assignment 10, it said something about the “laminar approach” and I’m not sure what that is.
 Something that was confusing in today’s class was how to do the in-class assignment, I wasn’t sure where to do the assignment until I read the description you put in the zoom chat. 
 I would like for you to explain parts 4 and 5 of assignment 10 a little more in depth as just reading it was a bit confusing. I think it was hard to understand because I didn’t understand exactly what it meant by mathematical models. 
 I needed more time to do the in class assignment. I always run out of time in the assignments that are due in class, and this leaves me behind during the class.
 Laminar approach in the A10 assignment was a little difficult to understand
 the new project a10 was pretty confusing and I want some more info about it
 I feel as though I took in all the information and wasn’t necessarily confused by any particular part of today’s class. 
 There wasn’t anything too particularly confusing in today’s class meeting, however, I did find the introduction discussion on the reservoir information to be a little brief. I was slightly confused about how this specific reservoir worked, however, the in class activity did end up resolving this.
 Maybe we could have gone over how hydroelectric power works a little more before talking about the Taum Sauk reservoir.
 How much does our CATME score rating affects our peers grades
 Part V of Tech Brief is really confusing 
 One subject that needed a little more elaboration would be information literacy. It was confusing because I needed a little more info on in text citations.
 I found what sections we are supposed to do in the the assignment, especially what a laminar approach is. I do not know how to compute this. 
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Something that needed a little more clarification was probably the different ways of searching for reputable sources. 
 I didn’t find anything about this lecture confusing.
 How to search for data quickly.
 The models for assignment A10 needs some explaination for clarification.
 What is the procedure for having only 3 members in a group?
 Our teammates and I were take hard time to realize what is the goal of the assignment 10. It will be appreciated more clear explanation about assignment.
 Nothing was confusing. Everything was well explained. 
 The assignment instructions for A10 were a little confusing, but talking it over with the team cleared things up. I think the information about citing and using scholarly sources was clear and helpful. 
 I didn't find anything confusing today.
 It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.
 What type of graph the assignment wants us to do. Also how to interpret the data
 I was confused on parts of assignment A10
 I was confused as to whether the walls of the dam sloped inward or outward.
 Although I was not confused on anything, I did feel like the agenda of the meeting covered a lot of information, which made me feel a little overwhelmed. However, after discussing with my group, I was able to clarify any questions and concerns.
 I was confused on the Catme calibration necessary for assingment 9. I simply submitted my survey and responses, but was confused on whether I had to calibrate first or not. I'm just hoping I did it right.
 Not much of anything was very confusing. The one thing I would label as confusing would be that on bright space it says that a10 is due at class 5a and you said it was due 5b.
 I needed more details on the assignment 10 and what should be the final thing to turn in for that
 nothing 
 What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class. I understand that using google and Wikipedia is only good for generic searches, but using all scholarly sources can be problematic when trying to find general information. I was just confused because it sounds like we can’t use these sources, but scholarly ones are too specific. 
 how to use the outside resources information in the research 
 I was confused about if you wanted us to only use google scholar articles,i also was confused about assignment 9 mainly because i joined a bit after the meeting had started due to wifi issues. I also was confused about how much that was needed to be written for he in class assignment.
 Something that needed more detail in today’s class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10). Information on Laminar Flow and other topics that others may not know about can be explained, even if briefly, to help give a general idea of the topic to the students.","i was having wifi problems at the beginning of the class so the discussion at the beginning was confusing. I didn’t really understand which sources were acceptable for this class. I know which sources are more reliable than others, but not which degree of reliability is acceptable for class assignments.

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn't really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn't seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today's class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today's class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn't know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I'm still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for awhile. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today's class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
  
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using

What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn’t know what to do. -> 3
Nothing was confusing today during class -> 1
I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data. -> 3
I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from -> 4

How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. -> 2
I wasn’t really confused today -> 1
Assignment 5 because we did not go over it. -> 2
The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn’t seem to have much discription. -> 2
I find probability in general confusing. -> 4
I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. -> 3
The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. -> 3
I would’ve appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point. -> 2
Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve. -> 4
Nothing, class was great as usual -> 1
Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation. -> 3
I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. -> 2
Today’s class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation -> 1
Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5? -> 1
I am not sure about exactly what z value does -> 2
Everything went well in today’s class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn’t know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it. -> 1
There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. -> 2
I thought that we could’ve spent a little more time on probability, since it’s what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps. -> 1
Nothing really -> 1
The main confusing part about today’s class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project. -> 3
The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before. -> 3
I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. -> 3
I’m still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. -> 1
Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. -> 1

I didn’t find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for awhile. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd -> 2
Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6. -> 3

The description of assignment 8 was confusing -> 4
Nothing was confusing to me today. -> 1
Nothing was very confusing about today’s class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. -> 4
Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration. -> 3
The way to calculate the curve with integrals. -> 3
Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral) -> 4
I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?) -> 3
I thought the explanations of the skittles stuff could be explained a bit more. It was a bit unclear but not too bad. -> 1
The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better. -> 4
What we had to do in class -> 3
It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it. -> 1
The assignments some times are very confusing. We don’t even go through them and the PDFs don’t say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear. -> 3
Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later. -> 2
How to organize my data -> 2
It’s confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05 -> 4
I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab. -> 2

What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity -> 2
I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came -> 5
Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don’t know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using -> 2
I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation -> 1
Nothing, today was pretty straightforward -> -
The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it’s a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use -> 3
How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? -> 1

The assignments some times are very confusing. We don’t even go through them and the PDFs don’t say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
How to organize my data
It’s confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don’t know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using
I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
Nothing, today was pretty straightforward
The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it’s a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage?
I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages.","Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would’ve liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn’t know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn’t really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn’t seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would’ve appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today’s class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today’s class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn’t know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could’ve spent a little more time on probability, since it’s what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today’s class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I’m still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I’m still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn’t find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for awhile. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today’s class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today’s class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
 I thought the explanations of the skittles stuff could be explained a bit more. It was a bit unclear but not too bad. 
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.

 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could’ve spent a little more time on probability, since it’s what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today’s class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I’m still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I’m still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn’t find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for awhile. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today’s class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining. 
 The description of assignment 8 was confusing
 Nothing was confusing to me today.
 Nothing was very confusing about today’s class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
 I thought the explanations of the skittles stuff could be explained a bit more. It was a bit unclear but not too bad. 
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don’t even go through them and the PDFs don’t say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It’s confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don’t know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it’s a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ","Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing.

the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data.
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data?
I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn’t know what to do.
Nothing was confusing today during class
I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better
The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score.
I wasn’t really confused today
Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn’t seem to have much discription.
I find probability in general confusing.
I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles.
The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it.
I would’ve appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
Nothing, class was great as usual
Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data.

I am not sure about exactly what z value does
Everything went well in today’s class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn’t know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team.
I thought that we could’ve spent a little more time on probability, since it’s what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.

What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity -> 2
I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came -> 5
Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using -> 2
I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation -> 1
Nothing, today was pretty straightforward -> -
The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use -> 3
How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? -> 1
I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more. -> 3
Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. -> 3","Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works. -> 4
the assignment number 5 -> 3
I felt all the details were clear during this class -> 1
One thing that was confusing about today's class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. -> 4
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for? -> 4

I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost. -> 4
What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do. -> 4

I find probability in general confusing. -> 3
I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. -> 3
The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. -> 4
I would've appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point. -> 4
Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve. -> 3

There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. -> 4
I thought that we could've spent a little more time on probability, since it's what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps. -> 4
Nothing really -> 1
The main confusing part about today's class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project. -> 4
The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before. -> 4
I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. -> 3
I'm still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. -> 4

Nothing was confusing to me today. -> 1
Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. -> 4
Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration. -> 4

Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral) -> 3
I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?) -> 4
I thought the explanations of the skittles stuff could be explained a bit more. It was a bit unclear but not too bad. -> 4
The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better. -> 4

 Nothing was very confusing about today's class. Instead, we had confusion about how to deal with the large number of data points in assignment 5A because the sheet reached around 50,000 data values. There seemed like too many values to analyze properly. 
 Some of the ideas revolving around z score were confusing and could have used more descriptions and deeper exploration.
 The way to calculate the curve with integrals.
 Determining how to find standard deviation from the z-scores (formula with the integral)
 I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
 I thought the explanations of the skittles stuff could be explained a bit more. It was a bit unclear but not too bad. 
 The thing that confused me was the whole concept of z scores and the process of calculating them. However, as the discussion continued I started to understand a little better. I think after practice with the concept I can understand it better.
 What we had to do in class 
 It would be helpful to have more detail about z scores and data analysis by using it.
 The assignments some times are very confusing. We don't even go through them and the PDFs don't say all the information sometimes needed for it to be clear.
 Had to watch the class recording since my internet was down, but the recordings are as good as the class (sometimes even more helpful since I can pause the video and take down notes). During the live class could good points by students/ professor be typed out on the slide or chat so I can compile them for later.
 How to organize my data
 It's confusing how we have to compile all of the data for assignment A05
 I would have liked more details on the A08 assignment, specifically with the ""new data"" tab.
 N/A - I felt like everything was clearly explained and I know how to do all my homework!
 What assignments we were supposed to be working on in breakout rooms and what was to be done with the in-class activity
 I think what was needed to be in done in all those excels sheets and everything needed to be clearer as breakout rooms doesnt let us talk to the professor or the TA directly and so we were in the dark for the most time until our ta came
 Exactly what we need to do for a05 was the most confusing for me because we don't know what to formulate our problem statement on it what data we are using 
 I was originally confused on if we needed to turn something in for class participation
 Nothing, today was pretty straightforward 

 The z score information is still a bit confusing for me. I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 How to change the histogram that is the frequency to percentage? 
 I didnt understand what A08 was ask8ng when they referred to 'addressing' the missing data, and i would've liked it if there were more examples that were shown throuh excel to show us how to use excel more.
 Something I found confusing or needing of more detail was the adjustment of the x-axis values of the histogram into percentages. ","In this lecture, students were confused about the instructions for Assignment 8, especially how to address the missing data. Some students also struggled with Assignment 5. Furthermore, students expressed confusion about how to find and use z-scores and what they meant. Students also think they would benefit from more practice with probability. Finally, students were confused about the directions for the in class work and how to complete and submit the Skittles assignment.","I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bitconfusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use |_|  Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z numberwas used in the calculus equation for area under the curve. |_| I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing |_| Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. |_| I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, duringtheskittles assignment my group struggled to understand what theobjectivewas, so I had to explain it myself for awhile","Assignment 8, A08

I would’ve liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
the assignment number 5
I felt all the details were clear during this class
One thing that was confusing about today’s class was how to switch the x-axis to a percentage from a numerical value in the skittle example. I was just confused as to if there is an easy way to change it or if that is just something you have to calculate and then set as a new type of data. 
We needed more details about what we were using the class' skittle data for. There is already a PDF of skittle data for Assignment 08 so what was our data for?
Today I thought that assignment 8 was confusing. I was struggling with how to handle the missing data in excel.
How was the data on people age gathered from Excel? I thought that many of the birth dates where redundant.
Bike share group project.
The z score was roughly explained

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data? 
 I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.
 What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn’t know what to do.
 Nothing was confusing today during class
 I think I need more practice with the concepts of probability and standard distribution of data.
 I didn't understand where the .06 value for the standard deviation came from
 The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better 
 The explanation for what to do for assignment 08
 How to decide how similar distribution s are to the normal distribution and when to use the z-score. 
 I wasn’t really confused today
 Assignment 5 because we did not go over it.
 The material for A08 seemed like it needed a little extra detail since the module as a whole doesn’t seem to have much discription.
 I find probability in general confusing. 
 I felt like the explanation regarding the process of finding the probability of a skittles bag having over 27% yellow skittles. 
 The z score was a little bit confusing. I did watch the module prior to class, however it still throws me off. I understand the concept behind it but feel I would like more practice and work with it. 
 I would’ve appreciated more time spent on the expectations for each assignment, such as a read through of the instructions and the expectation for each point.
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
 Nothing, class was great as usual
 Assignment 8 was confusing to understand where each part was because of explanation.
 I was confused on what to do with the missing dat is assignment 8 because we did not want to just omit the data. 
 Today’s class was very detailed and does not need any extra explanation
 Are we supposed to download all of the data in the year for AO5?
 I am not sure about exactly what z value does
 Everything went well in today’s class. I was only a little confused as to where to find the actual in class assignment as we didn’t know if the images were the correct assignment. But that is it.
 There wasn't ample directions given to fully navigate the tasks at hand. However, we were able to solve any confusing questions with my team. 
 I thought that we could’ve spent a little more time on probability, since it’s what our assignment is over. I still think it was adequate, but some more practice always helps.
 Nothing really
 The main confusing part about today’s class was figuring out where to go for the skittle submission and also if Assignment 08 was a team project or an individual project.
 The equation for finding z-value was a little confusing at first because I have never used it before.
 I feel like the lectures are more reading off the slides than actually teaching the content on the slides. 
 I’m still a little bit confused about all the variable in normal distributions so it would be great if you could go over those in more detail. 
 Today class was less confusing than other classes. We got more breakout time which I really appreciate. 
 Nothing was confusing for me
 submitting the skittles activity was kinda confusing but besides that everything was very nice
 I needed more details on the concept of a Z-score: I’m still not sure what it determines. 
 I didn’t find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for awhile. Because the organization of the assignment in bright space was a little odd
 Going over probability was a little confusing and how to graph the bell curves on excel. More details on that will probably help with assignment 6.
 nothing, everything was clear today
 Data types 
 One topic that required more details from today’s class was how probability from a histogram can be applied.
 The bell curve relating to relative probability was confusing. 
 How to use z-scores and their relationships were confusing and needed more explaining.

skittles 
Learning about z scores and how mean and standard deviation relate
What I found interesting about today’s class was how easy probability can be calculated when looking at a normal histogram. 
I found the usefulness of z-scores interesting and how they work.
Today I enjoyed learning about the z scores and probability because statistics was always interesting to me in high school and I enjoy learning about it.
I found that being able to convert any sort of distribution to a normal distribution was interesting.

Calculating z values 
The fact that our data is used for next class is pretty interesting because we the students are part of the data we work with.
Going over the due dates for the upcoming assignments 
 I liked the addition of probability, the normal curve and z scores to our class. I feel that is going to be helpful in the future.
 The z scores and probability was well explained especially with the little bit of new material.
 i found it interesting to work in breakout rooms and talk to my teammates.
 I found interesting the application of real life products like skittles to probability and standard distribution.
 I really like the Skittles assignment.
 The different data that we were using to do the skittles project 
 How a normal curve in a histogram can be transformed into a frequency percentage
 z-scores can help to find probability of certain events. 
 The use of z-scores
 Skittle activity was fun to do.
 I really liked the breakout rooms because it felt like my group accomplished a lot and asked questions when needed. I also felt like the Z score information was helpful because it cleared up some confusion from the “complete before class” module.
 I found the time spent working with my group and getting to know them better was most interesting. 
 I found it interesting how the normal distribution and the standard deviation/z score can be used to find the probability of certain events occurring. 
 I found the idea of finding probability through z scores very interesting. I am not used to working with histograms and enjoy the many benefits of using them over a regular chart. 
 I enjoyed learning about standardization as it seems like it will be very useful in interpreting data and calculating probability. It was also fun to solve the skittles problem using this new method.
 The connection of probability and histograms was very interesting to me.
 Skittles are weird
 The z data as well as the chart of percentages was interesting and seems like a very useful tool.
 I really enjoyed learning about Z scores and probability. I liked how you showed us how we can use probability to find interesting statistics. 
 Today’s assignment 8 was very interesting and easy to understand. 
 The application of z scores was interesting to see how it is used to create predictions and see trends
 using Z score chart was the most interesting
 I found the skittles to be a fun and interesting example of how to use our skills to actually do something.
 I learned more about the applications of Z-score and the breakdown of how it is used. 
 I thought that the z-score was the most interesting part, considering the table seems very easy and straightforward to use.
 Histogram uses in excel
 The most interesting part of today’s class was learning about the probability aspects of a histogram and everything about z scores and stuff.
 I found the z table most interesting because it’s on easy way to find z value from data.
 What was interesting in today’s class was learning some more about z values
 I thought it was interesting to try and learn real world applications of the statistical concepts we were learning. 
 Today most interesting thing that I found was working together with my team and start doing assignments together. 
 The z-product stuff was interesting to me because it incorporates math in a sense with area under a curve.
 using z scores and normal curves to figure out probabilities
 I found the histogram data interpretation interesting.
 The most interesting aspect of today’s class was defiantly learning the ability to compute the z-score. I think this will be a very valuable resource
 It was interesting how we can use the bell curve graphs to talk about probability. 
 Remembering how to do Z-scores
 Everything else was Interesting 
 One topic I found most interesting from today’s class was how histograms can be used for probability. 
 The most interesting thing today was in relation to standard deviation table. 
 I found how to find the probability of skittles interesting and that we have assignment 5 due Wednesday very interesting! 
 The breakout rooms were good
 I actually find the excel histograms very interesting!
 I found the z scores way of analyzing the chart area interesting with its calculus. 
 I found how we can use histograms and z-scores to determine the probability of certain things happening in data sets 
 The fact that you can use histograms to solve probability problems.
 The function of the z-score
 I enjoyed learning how to input data in a team.
 I enjoyed working with my group to complete the assignments because we got to work together and finish the work as a group
 The thing that I found most interesting was the just the projects in general. Studio time was interesting and I find it interesting how the team is starting to feel more comfortable with each other.
 The statistics.
 It was interesting to learn more about histograms and how they can be used
 As always I like when we can participate even with polls or talking in class. 
 How extensively a histogram can be used- I originally believed it was an equivalent to a bar chart but with histograms we can do a variety of calculations and interpretations which was very interesting since I never expected it. 
 How much data excel can handle so quickly
 I found finding the z score very interesting
 The normal curve was interesting to me because of the empirical rule which showed the percentages ofbthe data covered by each standard deviation of the curve.
 Like the previous classes, I love talking to my group and making sure everyone knows what their responsibilities are!!

I enjoyed working with my group to complete the assignments because we got to work together and finish the work as a group
The thing that I found most interesting was the just the projects in general. Studio time was interesting and I find it interesting how the team is starting to feel more comfortable with each other.
The statistics.
It was interesting to learn more about histograms and how they can be used
As always I like when we can participate even with polls or talking in class.
How extensively a histogram can be used- I originally believed it was an equivalent to a bar chart but with histograms we can do a variety of calculations and interpretations which was very interesting since I never expected it.
How much data excel can handle so quickly
I found finding the z score very interesting
The normal curve was interesting to me because of the empirical rule which showed the percentages ofbthe data covered by each standard deviation of the curve.
Like the previous classes, I love talking to my group and making sure everyone knows what their responsibilities are!!
zscore and how it can be used to find probability and such
We were able to count skittles as a little activity and I feel like that was the most interesting thing this class
I liked the idea of including us into counting the skittles to formulate our data however I didn't see how it connected to the rest of class because we didn't use it at all
I found it interesting to work on assignment 5 with my team and discuss our ideas for recommendations
Learning how to use the z score and putting it in practice
I found finding the probability using the histograms really interesting. It's helpful to know that the x axis in histograms can be changed to percentages to better interpret the data.
How powerful the excel can do.
I found it interesting to see z-scores, which i already knew about as i took ap Statistics during my senior year in high school. I also thought that finding out about the myu and standard deviation was fun to learn about.
What I found most interesting in today's class was the differences between using histograms with less frequencies for the probability and how that differs from using the normalized method or a graph with a higher number of frequencies.","I enjoyed discussing z scores and how they can be used to calculate probability. This is a very useful and practical skill that can be applied in many ways. It is nice to have a class which goes over how to use them and apply them.

 What I found most interesting in today’s class was the differences between using histograms with less frequencies for the probability and how that differs from using the normalized method or a graph with a higher number of frequencies.","In this lecture, students were most interested in learning about z-scores, especially the z-score chart. Students were also interested in how to find probabilities using z-scores, histograms, or from real data. Additionally, students enjoyed the Skittles assignmenet and getting to apply concepts to real data. Furthermore, students liked time spent working in teams. Finally, students were interested in how to normalize/standardize data, uses of normalized data, and how to convert this data back to frequencies.",I enjoyed discussing z scores and how they can be used to calculate probability. This is a very useful and practical skill that can be applied in many ways. It is nice to have a class which goes over how to use them and apply them. I really liked the breakout rooms because it felt like my group accomplished a lot and asked questions when needed. I also felt like the Z score information was helpful because it cleared up some confusion from the “complete before class” module. I found the idea of finding probability through z scores very interesting. I am not used to working with histograms and enjoy the many benefits of using them over a regular chart. I found interesting the application of real life products like skittles to probability and standard distribution.

zscore and how it can be used to find probability and such
We were able to count skittles as a little activity and I feel like that was the most interesting thing this class
I liked the idea of including us into counting the skittles to formulate our data however I didn't see how it connected to the rest of class because we didn't use it at all
I found it interesting to work on assignment 5 with my team and discuss our ideas for recommendations
Learning how to use the z score and putting it in practice
I found finding the probability using the histograms really interesting. It's helpful to know that the x axis in histograms can be changed to percentages to better interpret the data.
How powerful the excel can do.
I found it interesting to see z-scores, which i already knew about as i took ap Statistics during my senior year in high school. I also thought that finding out about the myu and standard deviation was fun to learn about.
What I found most interesting in today's class was the differences between using histograms with less frequencies for the probability and how that differs from using the normalized method or a graph with a higher number of frequencies.","I enjoyed discussing z scores and how they can be used to calculate probability. This is a very useful and practical skill that can be applied in many ways. It is nice to have a class which goes over how to use them and apply them.

The initial set up. Specifically the limits of integration and the variable of integration. -> 3
Some of the Calc concepts needed some review before I could fully apply them to Physics. -> 4
Determining when to use cos or sin for integration of a ring of charge. Also drawing dE vectors along the z-axis was a bit confusing for me. -> 4
I felt the lecture was going too fast and felt that we should go over details more rather than flying through each tophat question. -> 4
Ring of charge calculations -> 2
The class problem regarding finding the x component of Electric field. -> 3
I was confused about the example that we went over because of the perpendicular and parallel forces. I think that part through me off so I think doing more examples would be helpful for me. -> 4

I am confused on how to figure out what dq should be in example problems that use that equation -> 4
I am somewhat confused on what dq/ds represent in the problems in parts 3/4 of this lecture series. -> 2
I am really having trouble setting up integrals for the electric field. I don’t understand how to set it up given the linear density and the charge. -> 5
While I understand the solving the integral process, I could use more clarity/examples of setting up integrals in different situations. Also, a deeper explanation of what exactly is happening to the electric field when influenced by an extended charge. -> 2
The ring of charge section was the most confusing. Setting it up and finding E parallel and E perpendicular was the most confusing for me -> 3
I was a little confused where L+d came from in the linear charge integral. -> 2
The limits on the integrals confused me the most. I did not know why some of them changed midway through the problem. -> 4
How to determine the setup for the charges. The integration isn’t difficult it is more the choosing what to use. Also I am a bit unclear when it comes to the sanity checks. -> 3
I was confused about recognizing which variable you should take the the integral with respect to (depending on the problem) -> 3
The second question on the concept quiz gave me issues and made me pretty confused, especially when it came to setting up the integral. -> 3

The initial set up. Specifically the limits of integration and the variable of integration.
Some of the Calc concepts needed some review before I could fully apply them to Physics.
Determining when to use cos or sin for integration of a ring of charge. Also drawing dE vectors along the z-axis was a bit confusing for me.
I felt the lecture was going too fast and felt that we should go over details more rather than flying through each tophat question.
Ring of charge calculations
The class problem regarding finding the x component of Electric field.
I was confused about the example that we went over because of the perpendicular and parallel forces. I think that part through me off so I think doing more examples would be helpful for me.
Ring of charge and the symmetry cancellation
I am confused on how to figure out what dq should be in example problems that use that equation
I am somewhat confused on what dq/ds represent in the problems in parts 3/4 of this lecture series.
I am really having trouble setting up integrals for the electric field. I don't understand how to set it up given the linear density and the charge.
While I understand the solving the integral process, I could use more clarity/examples of setting up integrals in different situations. Also, a deeper explanation of what exactly is happening to the electric field when influenced by an extended charge.
The ring of charge section was the most confusing. Setting it up and finding E parallel and E perpendicular was the most confusing for me
I was a little confused where L+d came from in the linear charge integral.
The limits on the integrals confused me the most. I did not know why some of them changed midway through the problem.
How to determine the setup for the charges. The integration isn't difficult it is more the choosing what to use. Also I am a bit unclear when it comes to the sanity checks.
I was confused about recognizing which variable you should take the the integral with respect to (depending on the problem)
The second question on the concept quiz gave me issues and made me pretty confused, especially when it came to setting up the integral.
Water droplet problem is what I had the most trouble with.
The practice problem where we were given the dipole dipole moment and had to find kinetic energy was quite challenging for me. If we could do another example like that, that would be great!

I think find emf and voltage difference could be gone over a little more. Maybe an example with a diagram instead of graph would benefit us more conceptually 
Resistors 
I found the example of discharging a real battery a bit confusing as it is hard to recognize R and r. 
The group problems
I thought the examples at the end of the cuvids for the first set were a little confusing, I wasn’t sure how the equations were derived
The conceptual tophat questions about current vs voltage were most confusing for me because I don’t fully understand the relationship between the two. 
I think I actually understood this one well. The only thing I truly struggled was the second part with the battery, the E and the delta V
 Trying to figure out if things are in series or parallel
 For the first time ever in this class I feel like I actually understand all the cuvids for this section.
 I’d say power was the most confusing part. 
 Relating delta V=emf to delta V=IR
 I found it confusing how and what resistors actually do.  I find it confusing because I am doing calculations and finding numbers but don’t know what they do. 
 More examples and discussion of differences between conductors, semiconductors etc 
 I was confused about how you can tell when resistors are in parallel/series
 It wasn’t confusing, but I think going over Ohm’s law and when you can and can’t use it would be helpful 
 the relationship between the internal voltage of a battery vs. the external voltage.

I thought that it was a little confusing why in the 1st example you performed you added the non matching capacitance (C3) with C2 and plugged that into the expression. and on our sapling concept quiz, we instead used expression (C1*C2)/(C1+C2)+ C3.  why were we allowed to do that for that problem and not this one? genuinely confused. 
I was confused about how you know when capacitors are in parallel with each other.
 The equation for Fnet using drift velocity
 I'm having trouble conceptualizing and visualizing these topics so examples and explanations of concepts would help. Also, how is electric current/density acts in insulators
 The difference in using the formula c1*c2/c1+c2 vs using the equation for parallel capacitance or series capacitance confuses me a bit on the concept quiz. 
 I found it confusing defining what C equivalence was. ","I'm a little confused on how charge is distributed on capacitors in series vs capacitors in parallel.
