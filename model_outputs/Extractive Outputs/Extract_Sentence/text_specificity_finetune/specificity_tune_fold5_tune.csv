" I think the angle at which flux flows from an object is a bit confusing. The first problem on the concept quiz deals with this. 
 More examples would be helpful for further understanding. 
 i think the last practice problem we did in class could've been done slower to make it easier to comprehend. i had to think it over for a few minutes after class ended for it to come to me 
 I was confused about why we find the areas of the three different parts of the cylinder, and how we do this. 
 I did not understand why the electric field inside of a solid, uniform, insulating sphere (rR). ","I did not understand why the electric field inside of a solid, uniform, insulating sphere (r<R) is greater than the field outside of it (r>R).
I think the idea and concepts make sense, but I am confused about what shapes to choose as the Gaussian surface. Can you choose any shape? Are there multiple shapes that will still give the same answer as the cylinder? Also, the conductor vs insulator in reference to Gauss' law is confusing to me
The second question on the concept quiz confused me, I wasn't sure how positive and negative charges being outside or inside affect flux.

" The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.” 
 There was a large amount of calculus in these videos with derivatives that I don't remember well. Therefore, the math was a little but hard to follow. Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
 Going in depth for more problems in class 
 nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well 
 N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind. ","I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.

 Having the class time to work with team on coming up with a plan for these assignments 
 I'm really interested to see how weighted decision matrices can be used outside of engineering, even in making everyday decisions. It just seems like something very applicable to everyday life. 
 There was not much else besides the weighted matrix that was discussed in class, so bot much to report here 
 I liked the amount of time we had to work on A18 ","I found it interesting how we can use the weighted decision matrix and figure out which solution is best for our problem.

" The most interesting thing I found was the logistics of the class and how we are supposed to complete projects 
 I found the class to be interesting and interactive. I enjoyed meeting fellow students as this helped me to feel more comfortable and overall welcome in the class. 
 I enjoyed the breakout sessions. They really allowed me to talk more in-depth with specific people, rather than just watching the instructor. It made the whole experience a lot more initiating and interactive. 
 I thought that the layout of the course was interesting and the activity of drawing our view of an engineer was very interesting. The layout is 4 main projects and I thought that it was cool to be in that format rather than many smaller projects. The drawing was interesting because it made you look to the future. 
 I liked how we went over what the course would look like and who we could contact for help. ","I loved the breakout rooms and the chance to meet new people.

" I found the carbon footprint information confusing because I was not sure how to take the environmental data from A13 and reflect a carbon footprint. 
 The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity. 
 I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time. 
 I did not think anything was too confusing, but one thing that was difficult to understand was the criteria vs constraints 
 There wasn't really anything in today's lecture that I found to be confusing or unclear. Everything stated was easily understood and tied in directly to being an engineer and our current project. Explanation of environmental impacts and the inclusion of what is the priority of being an engineer helped emphasize the point that we need to always be thinking of how our developments effect others in society. ","The carbon emissions calculation was a little confusing because I didn't understand where the numbers were coming from at first. The example after the in class activity cleared things up.
I was confused about the in class activity at first but when I discussed it with my group we figured it out.

 The project objective is arguably better than the other class's. 
 starting our own design project 
 I did not realize that we had been slowly incorporating different aspects of design into our assignments 
 Before today's class I was really confused on who a stakeholder was. Today's class really clarified that for me. It was interesting to have it clarified bc I'd been confused on it for so long. ","I liked the discussion on the importance of problem scoping and the differences between novice and professional engineers. Particularly asking questions and research.
The breakout room was very fun and informative! We met Jeff Hall today, and he was extremely helpful. We love working in a team and we're excited for the upcoming project. 
What I found most interesting in today's class was how a client or end user was a stakeholder always but a stakeholder could be a client or end user, but is not necessarily always one. 
 The start of a new projects is always interesting I feel that seeing how a project could be integrated so close to me is one of the most exciting things about being an engineer 
What I found most interesting about today's class was the analytical skills that are required to design your own solution to aproblem."

 I found the brainstorming aspect of the class the most interesting because my team was flowing and the ideas were getting somewhere. The talk about prototyping was interesting and got me excited to work on the assignment. 
 Something interesting was learning about prototypes and how to make them, including the 3D printing lab that Purdue has. 
 The discussion about next steps and designing prototypes 
 I found learning about CAD softwares and 3D printing at Purdue most interesting. ","I found it interesting how effective CAD modeling can be for startingthe prototyping phase, I also found it awesome how many services Purduehas to offer to aid in the prototyping process.
The act of prototyping is interesting because we can test our ideas.
I found the wholistic approach of the design project very interesting and am very excited to move forward with it

 I was confused as to how to use/create the chart under functional decomposition but my team helped me out. 
 I didn't think anything was confusing for today's class. I thought it all made sense and was very clear. One thing that I think could significantly improve our class is making the class slides available in Brightspace once the class begins. This would be very helpful to the teams, because often what we are working on in the assignment during team class time is related to what was in the slides and what we went over in the class.

" A few answers to questions, particularly about discrete vs continuous and numerical vs categorical data types, were difficult to understand. It wouldv'e been nice to hear another perspective or source about these, maybe a GTA or PT's opinion as well. 
 It was a little bit confusing figuring out how to edit the overflow data. Also, this is part of the Modules not the class but I don't understand why the center of a bin is not just the middle number of that bins range (in the module 31 was not the answer for the range 30-32). 
 I didn't understand how to format the histogram axis in excel. Excel automatically adjusts bin width and bin numbers 
 The part of class that was confusing was how to find bin width. Or more of once you find it do you need to round it up or to the nearest whole number? 
 It is difficult for mac users to submit assignments and edit in excel so more information on how to do assignments would be helpful. ","The only part of today's class was being able to identify the type of data.
