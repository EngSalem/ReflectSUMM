" I like that the math is pretty consistent and the laws and theorems are pretty easily definable I just get messed up when you're doing demonstrations that move really quickly and the words go over my head. 
 The explanation of your plastic sheet and lightbulb experiment was really neat and caught my interests. 
 I found it interesting how similar electric force is to gravitational force. 
 The group work in solving the distribution of charge 
 The conservation of energy question was very tricky. I was indecisive between the correct answer and the “difference in charge” answer, so I felt that I learned the most from this question. ","I thought the demonstration with the lightbulb was fun to watch. It gave me a visual representation of what was happening.
i really like learning about the electric charges and i like learning about electrons after taking so many chemistry classes
Energy conservation in particle physics with a gamma ray photon being split into an electron and positron was very intriguing since I've never learned much about gamma rays in the past.
I found it interesting how similar electric force is to gravitational force.
The amount of interaction we were able to have with you as an instructor and in breakout rooms was interesting."
" Magnetic fields and discharging capacitors 
 the differential equation portion involving RC circuits was a little confusing. Another example would be very much helpful for a lot of us I think. 
 The concept quiz question 
 I wasn't really confused by anything this lecture. 
 I honestly didn't really find anything confusing. Everything just made sense, however it did help that I am currently in my differential equations class, and I had a really strong foundation of physics 1 to help with the magnetic field concepts.

I was confused about how to use a calculator to solve matrices.
I find the orientation of magnetic fields very confusing. I'm not sure how to tell if it should be pointing in or out of the page, why it is always in the positive or negative k direction, or how it affects which direction a particle will circle in."
" The planar electric field being constant 
 The return of the shell theorem to explain a more complicated concept 
 The fact that we can model something as complex as flux through symmetrical objects without needing to carry out complex integrals 
 the different types of symmetry 
 I found it neat and helpful that drawing a Gaussian surface around or through certain objects with uniform surface charge makes finding E on the object much easier. However knowing how to orient the Gaussian surface seems a bit difficult in some situations. ","The planar electric field being constant

" The rc time unit was interesting. 
 I found it interesting that magnetic fields are so similar to electric fields. 
 I really like that magnetic field lines follow the same rules as electric field lines. I also like that magnetic monopoles haven't been discovered! 
 I found the balloon example interesting because it tied what we were learning to a more real world experience/possibility 
 It's interesting how electrons move in circular motion around a magnetic field. Also it is interesting how many times we use the cross product. ","It's interesting how the current of an RC circuit is essentially a fraction of the original current dependant on the time constant.
I found the magnetic field lines interesting because no matter how small they get they will always have a north and a south end.
I found the balloon tophat question most interesting about today's class because I thought too hard about it at first and once it was explained it was an “ah” moment
I really enjoyed writing the circuit equations in terms of one another and then forming differential equations. On top of already enjoying this unit, I really like this kind of math as well
I really like that magnetic field lines follow the same rules as electric field lines. I also like that magnetic monopoles haven't been discovered!"
" The right hand rule is clearer to me after Dr. Nero explained it again in class 
 The thing that I found most interesting was the right hand demonstration for vectors

" Break out rooms were fun and enjoyable 
 Analyzing the different approaches/ways to get the same solution 
 What was the most interesting was physically solving the kinematic problems. It's like a puzzle to me. 
 The most interesting part was learning about free fall and comparing the graphs 
 The dinosaurs (Jurassic park vibes), and the intro to group was interesting, because it gave me an idea of how things will work in the future for quizzes and tophat questions. ","The dinosaur problem was most interesting. I enjoyed that it really challenged you to think about how to set the equations equal to each other and which equation to pick.
I like projectile motion from my high school physics class so when this video lecture began to talk about gravity and free fall, I really enjoyed it. 
I enjoyed the conceptual top hat questions during this lecture. These connections brought a true understanding of how kinematics work in real life (neglecting air resistance of course).
understanding and getting the majority of the problems asked in tophat correct. this means that i have some sort of a grasp and understand of the topic we're on. 
 found the breakout rooms to be the most interesting. Working as a team is always more productive as I was able to hear different approaches to solving the problem."
" I thought question 2 was confusing because I wasn't sure what to do with the acceleration exactly because block 2 was heavier than block 1. 
 There was no lecture today. 
 N/A (no class today so nothing was confusing, or more accurately, no lecture was confusing) 
 The first problem, particularly finding how the thrower and the kicker relate 
","There was no video lecture in class as we took the exam. The first problem on the test was a little confusing in the sense that interpreting the time we were supposed to find was difficult.

 I found the monkey problem interesting because it proves a real world situation with our understanding of projectile motion 
 I actually understood how to do projectile problems! 
 The physics behind the monkey and bullet example, where aiming for the monkey before falling will make the bullet hit it. 
 I appreciated the video demonstrating the monkey because it helped me to visualize the equation. ","Definitely the monkey hunting problem. Although I was  confused by thesolution, i was really intrigued by the scenario. It was fascinatingthat the monkey fell right as the golf ball was released, and it madeimpact right before the monkey hit the ground. 
 I thought that relative motion was the most interesting, since it gives you multiple perspectives.

 The coefficient of friction, either static or kinetic, is usually smaller than 1. 
 I found it interesting that surface area does not affect the force it takes for a mass to slide off a surface. 
 Working in breakout rooms was enjoyable ","I thought learning about the coefficient of friction and how it's proportional to the normal force was interesting. 
 I found the description of static friction most interesting. I thinkstatic friction is more interesting than kinetic friction because whenstatic friction reaches it's maximum value, any amount of force appliedwill accelerate the object.
Dr. Nero demonstrate how to solve friction problems with 2 body diagrams set up
Learning about the relationship between normal force and friction and how friction works and looks molecularly.
I found learning about how friction was really interesting. It was coolto understand how the cold welds between two surfaces impacted friction."

 I struggled with the idea of how each variable impacts the overall equation for the drag force. 
 I need more clarification about why the acceleration vector points in toward the center. 
 The most confusing part of the lecture was determining the centripetal force. 
 I thought the problem with the skydiver into the ocean was confusing because there were too many variables. ","What was confusing about this lecture was what forces can be considered a centripetal force.  I saw that soletimes it can be the normal force or some other force.
 I think it was tough to conceptualize some of the drag force problems. Although it's not going to be a heavy focus for the exam, I would've liked to connect more drag force problems to conceptual ideas.
 circular motion was barely even taught, especially the net force portion 
the lesson moved really fast for such a complicated topic. deriving the equations was confusing and there weren't enough examples or applications to understand the formulas
I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes. However, your explanation cleared itup. The application of multiple g's tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g."
" Energy calculations 
 I found the assignment 13 to be confusing at first because there was very little instruction about how to approach it. Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project. 
 we learned about the new project, so it was pretty straightforward and clear 
 Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13 
 The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.

 The original concept of the if statement and else was confusing at first, but when it was explained and the examples were shown it made more sense. With more practice I understood it. 
 I was confused on some of the input commands and how to operate them after typed out. 
 i was confused about what the elseif command is used for specifically. my group helped me figure it out thoigh.  ","I couldn't hear anything from the zoom meeting, so I'm sure I missed quite a bit. I don't know if the ica is a group activity, and if it is, I don't have a good way to contact my team. I also don't know what my team number is.
