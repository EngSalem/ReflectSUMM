Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day. 
 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz.

" I thought the most difficult aspect of today's class was determining how to prototype our ideas to show the functionality of them. 
 I was confused about how to make a prototype for one of our designs originally. 
 We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to our separation. Additionally we couldn't figure out doable but also reliable ways to test our prototypes. 
 I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype
