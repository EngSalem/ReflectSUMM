 Learning how voltmeters are able to get accurate voltage readings without leaking much current out of the circuit by being connected in parallel with resistors/capacitors. 
 i liked that no matter which path you took to find current in a circuit, you'll get the same value. 
 I thought your explanation of ammeters and voltmeters was very well done. This topic that was previously confusing to me in high school is now much clearer. I thought it was interesting thinking about how current runs through a wire and why each of these have to have very different resistances. 
 The circuit analysis about the voltage in loops summing to 0. ","The amount of info we can determine from a simple circuit with proper analysis is very cool.
I thought grounding was interesting. I never understood what grounding meant before.

 I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out 
 I really liked the problem that we did in breakout rooms. This was a good use of time because it allowed for my peers and I to think for ourselves and still be able to get help if needed 
 The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece) ","I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy tofollow. 
I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged inpractice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I enjoyed using Top Hat because it kept me active during the lesson."
" The top hat problem with the 3 blocks. We covered this towards the end, and as we were crunched for time, I thought the problem wasn't discussed as much as I would've liked. 
 I'm confused about why we assumed the force needed to hold the man still was the just the tension in the rope. 
 The problem that involved the man pulling himself up on a pulley was difficult to understand.  If the man is pulling down with the same force as the tension, shouldn't that cancel out one of the tensions ? 
 The last example we did in class. My group overthought it and then the solution was so simple. 
 When using gravity in equations for free body diagrams, why is it represented a positive instead of negative?

In today's lecture, I was bit confused by the free body diagram of friction. How would friction change if the normal force was at an angle to the horizontal? 
The fact of there being two tensions confused me for one of the first questions we did. I didn't quite get the 2T, but I think I understand it now after it was explained. 
 Force magnitudes when there are multiple masses such as a person pushing on three rocks. It's just sometimes confusing on which masses to add or the exact forces acting on the masses."

 Nothing was really confusing except how we were put in breakout rooms for a bit and then taken out of them for an announcement that could have just be typed in chat so we didn't have to leave breakout rooms. It would have let us keep our train of thought

 The discussion on modeling was a bit confusing, as we discussed what models were and did a few examples, but we didn't really talk about their importance.

Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day. 
 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz.

I found the logical operators the most interesting because they have so many applications
Using selection structures and the input function to create programs. It is interesting because we can make interactive programs now.
i thought it was interesting how you can use the script to find out text displays for different values."
" I think I need more practice with making a truth table. I was also struggling to predict the outcomes of logical operators. 
 I was confused on the default layout of matlab. My matlab has separated my script and my command tabs to separate pages and I am confused how to put it back.  
 The start of the second part of A06 is very confusing because it is completely new. 
 The information regarding logical operators and using them in combination with the find commanded was not clear. 
 assignment A06 ","I think I need more practice with making a truth table. I was also struggling to predict the outcomes of logical operators.
I found the third part of the in class activity as to what the variables represented.
I was confused on the default layout of matlab. My matlab has separated my script and my command tabs to separate pages and I am confused how to put it back.
I was confused for the components that I need to put for my plots for asssignment 06. I'm was not 100% sure about if I'm following the instructions correctly or not.
The difference between sgtitle and title for making titles for graphs. It can be confusing because some of the commands used are not applicable for both."
" ""How to display figures were confusing, specifically how you were to separate the figures so it didn't just display all 3 figures from A06 together on the same graph. The subplot counting was weird how it was the opposite of linear indexing but it was covered well so that worked out in the end."" 
 It was confusing to tell what to do when Professor Wible is over zoom. 
 ""For our 3A activity, I had difficulty understanding the graph. Whether the Y axis represented the VOC emissions from the production of the Subarus or from the exhaust from the actual cars. "" 
 i was confused as to why my readmatrix function was not allowing me to import the data file. it turns out that i needed to open the folder that the data file was in within the current folder.  
 there were a lot of variations to the plot making. it would have been nice to cover some of those.

The idea of creating multiple figures in one plot was pretty confusing to me. I was also confused about the components that I need to put in my plots.
It was confusing partly because I was on zoom so flipping back and forth between my brightpsace and zoom and Matlab is tricky.
I think that the array indexing is still confusing. I do not understand how to select values from only a row or a column
For our 3A activity, I had difficulty understanding the graph. Whether the Y axis represented the VOC emissions from the production of the Subarus or from the exhaust from the actual cars."
