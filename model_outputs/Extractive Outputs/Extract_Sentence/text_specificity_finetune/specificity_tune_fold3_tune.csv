" The integral part and the last problem that we did. I am always confused about how to set up the problem. 
 The second question on the second concept quiz was about conductors. If you could explain the answer in class that would be great. I cannot seem to wrap my head around it. 
 The difference between the voltage potential energy, the potential energy and then regular volatage. I just kept getting lost with the symbols and meanings 
 I didn't find anything really confusing, but I think it would be helpful to look at calculating potential from an electric field again 
 Trying to figure out what dq should equal while integrating ","The integral part and the last problem that we did. I am always confused about how to set up the problem.
The potential energy of the field was confusing.
the last top hat question could've had more explanation. i was confused on how to set it up
The concept addressed in the second concept question, regarding how fields are affected by other fields, was confusing.
Overall more examples, not necessarily solving but the setup, would be helpful as well as more explanation of dipoles and their potential energy"
" The ammeters and voltmeters, basically their properties and how does it change the current, and voltage 
 The clicker questions about grounding. 
 I am still a bit confused about why the voltage was negative in the first given example even though the voltage coming out of the battery is positive. 
 Figuring out how grounding will affect the potential 
 some of the ideas about grounding were confusing, especially with the top hat, but i think i have the general  idea that a grounded circuit has a voltage drop of 0. ","The idea of grounding was confusing for me. I feel like seeing some more examples would be helpful.
Problem 27.54 with the car motor problem was confusing. I did not understand what the starting motor does. Does it withdraw or add voltage? Does it act as a resistor or a battery? Otherwise your lectures were clear and concise as always.
I am still a bit confused about why the voltage was negative in the first given example even though the voltage coming out of the battery is positive.
Current for the last top hat circuit question that was graded
Re-drawing circuit diagrams with grounds seems  to get complicated when multiple branches and resistors/capacitors are involved."
" Extreme acceleration caused by terminal velocity into a body of water 
 The most interesting thing in today's lecture was calculating the acceleration a person feels when they hit the water from jumping from an airplane.  It showed that the body cannot stand such a massive increase in acceleration . 
 When we compared the drag force and gravity from air to water 
 Problems involving terminal velocity, drag 
 I found it interesting that even though earth has an acceleration, velocity can still become constant. ","I found the centripetal force problems to be very interesting. I usually enjoy relating centripetal force to conceptual ideas, so I enjoyed thatpart of the lecture.
 The terminal velocity question was also kinda cool because it explained why you can't just jump into water safely at large heights. 
The most interesting thing in today's lecture was calculating the acceleration a person feels when they hit the water from jumping from an airplane.  It showed that the body cannot stand such a massive increasein acceleration .
 The first few top hat problems about the steel ball vs the ping pong ball. Interesting real life examples.
I found the explanation of drag force most interesting because it is a topic O have never covered before."
" No lecture today. 
 The first problem on the test was interesting as it was a real life situation most have taken a part in. 
 I enjoyed group tests simply because people can guide my ideas and help me get the answer. 
 Same as before 
 N/A (it was interesting in a way once you got past the panic) ","The first problem on the test was interesting as it was a real life situation most have taken a part in.
The second question about the blocks was actually fun, I had done several like it while studying
The names of the football players were very interesting
There was no video to find anything interesting. The problems were interesting though
I enjoyed group tests simply because people can guide my ideas and help me get the answer."
" Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not. 
 Nothing was confusing today. It was all intro physics that I have learned my senior year. I definitely needed to brush up on it though because we had off from school for so long. That's how I feel about most of my classes though. 
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example. 
 I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2 
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again. ","Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
I need to work on using the correct kinematics equation. The concept of relative motion is confusing, because I can't understand reference views."
" One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why. 
 I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more. 
 I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360Â°. 
 Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable) 
 I didn't find anything confusing or unclear during today's class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I'm very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material. ","How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees.
Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it.

 More information on the low fidelity prototype 

 I did not find anything confusing nor did I think that anything discussed needed any more details in today's class. 
 I don't think anything was confusing today. ","on the quiz I put the y intercept because it did not specify but apparently that was incorrect. That is confusing to me.
I found the whiteboard brainstorming in class activity to be a little confusing as I wasn't entirely sure of what to draw and what not to.
We needed mor details on the assignment that is due next friday.
 More information on the low fidelity prototype 
The collaborative sketching attempt did not go well in class today. I wish we were explained how to make a collaborative sketch in breakout rooms."
" Nothing needed more explanation in today's class. I found everything to be very clear. However, I would have liked to know what kind of chart should have been submitted for the in class activity. 
 More in depth about how to make more complicated histograms 
 The lecture didn't confuse me at all, but when we started assignment A07, I couldn't figure out how to correctly change the bin widths. 
 Nothing much. I think I just need to get more comfortable using histograms and understanding how to set them up using excel. 
 I feel like everything seemed to be pretty straight forward today! I was not confused about anything today! I felt that we really went over histograms well and it seemed to make sense to me! ","A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful.
The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped.
I wish we saw the slide you were talking about that had al the due dates so we didn't have to find it later
The underflow and overflow was confusing for the bins.
The instructions for the in class assignment wasn't posted in the chat until near the end of the breakout room. This made the assignment difficult to complete."
" I found the brainstorming process very fun and challenging. 
 nothing 
 Finding pros and cons is interesting because each product or service you can think of always has a way to do it better

" I found the modeling aspect of the new assignment interesting. I'm excited to learn more about that and figure the project out. 
 I think learning about the reservoir, and doing some research on the history of the resource and about hydropower generators.  I think the introduction of a new project was very infesting. I also found the intro into how to cite and reference your sources to be very informative. 
 Working on real projects that are also interesting 
 I liked how we had group discussions I also liked how we got ahead on an assignment due next week and that we were given more time to work on projects so that we aren't cramming many at once. 
 I've never had to use APA before this class, so that will be interesting ","I thought learning about the hydroelectric power was interesting
 Seeing the mechanics of how reservoirs work

" Going over the due dates for the upcoming assignments 
 Calculating z values 
 I enjoyed discussing z scores and how they can be used to calculate probability. This is a very useful and practical skill that can be applied in many ways. It is nice to have a class which goes over how to use them and apply them. 
 I really like the Skittles assignment. 
 z-scores can help to find probability of certain events. ","Learning how to use the z score and putting it in practice

" At this point, the things I have the most issue with are basic technical things. I never did much with Excel or computers in high school, so saving and submitting is challenging occasionally. 
  There are many numbers relating to different assignments that sometimes it is hard to keep straight about which ones are due. 
 For the most part I understood a lot of the information in todays class, especially with the excel stuff. The only main confusing part was when we were discussing the different versions of average, but I was able to figure out why some of my answers in the poll were wrong during our class discussion. Also for the in person assignment I was confused as to what data we were using for the birthyear outlier activity, but my team helped me figure that out too. Other than that everything else went pretty well. I am excited to learn more during the next class. 
 What exactly the perimeters are for in class assignments 
 I didn't understand what people were saying about the tech brief assignment. I saw someone in the chat saying the due date was pushed back, however, I didnt receive any announcement of that. ","I think where to find our assignments, when they are due, what we have to do when is confusing.
The in-class activity was slightly confusing as to what the instructions were and what was wanted in the assignment.
The thing that I struggled with the most was just navigating Excel. I don't have a whole lot of experience with it, so it is going to take some practice to get the hang of it.
I thought some of the break rooms were a bit short especially the one where we first got assigned to our teams and had the excel project to work on. Everything else moved nicely
