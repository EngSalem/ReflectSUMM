"All of the different ways to use Ohm's Law by rearranging the equation
Ohms law
Circuit analysis
I thought it was interesting how batteries have their own resistance inside, ajd how this resistance changes with time
I found it interesting that current is constant when resistors are in series.","All of the different ways to use Ohm's Law by rearranging the equation
I thought it was nice at how easy calculating resistance was after proving with algebra that the resistors in series can just be additively calculated
I found it interesting how we are drawing circuits out. Also I found it interesting how we are starting to calculate how circuits work.
Power and how it relates to resistors

"I thought the fact that saltwater has less resistivity than freshwater was the most interesting!
The circuit problems were enlightening.
I found the parallel capacitors interesting because you are able to combine capacitors together when they are parallel to each other
Examining electricity in motion is reaply interesting after looking at it static for so long
Resistivity of uniform wire","I found it interesting how we are now drawing our circuits in series and parallel. Itvs interesting to see how electricity works in the real world.
How the current ""flows""through a conductor
Calculating capacitance in circuits
We can calculate the numeric value of complicated electrical concepts in physics.
I thought the example about the lightning bolt hitting the water was really cool. I also thought that the difference the current flows through saltwater and freshwater was interesting, even though it wasn't supposed to be part of our lesson."
"The use of a switch board, batteries, and all those things are confusing but are very interesting! Also it is getting harder to write these.
Dielectrics were interesting. Especially the physics of weaker dielectrics creating a dipole moment within the atoms despite it obviously having less forces to work with.
I found it interesting that dielectrics can change capacitance.
How different materials change epsilon naught was interesting.
Applying learned concepts to a more real world situation and seeing how it works/functions","Dielectrics were interesting. Especially the physics of weaker dielectrics creating a dipole moment within the atoms despite it obviously having less forces to work with.
Parallel plate capacitors seemed to make the most sense
I liked learning about the values of the different kinds of materials like air and paper, etc.

I found it interesting how we are now drawing circuits with batteries capacitors and switches and relating it to the equations we used in class."
"The part that confused me the most was when we were looking at a conductor and an insulator and trying to figure out the electric field value of each shell.
Choosing a Gaussian surface. I'm still not sure what types/orientations of surfaces produce symmetry that allow certain components to cancel out.
Maybe more into detail reg the choosing of Gaussian surface?
I found the whole concept of flux very unclear. I didn't really grasp it on the fundamental level and the mathematical interpretation of the concept doesn't make sense to me.
The integral equation. I think more examples would help","In the example problem, you would pull numbers and I was not sure where the numbers would be from. Could you be more clear on where these numbers would be coming from in class?

I was confused how to calculate the direction of the area vector.
The part that confused me the most was when we were looking at a conductor and an insulator and trying to figure out the electric field value of each shell."
"I found Faraday cages cancelling out external electric fields very interesting. It was also neat how the internal cap of a cylinder imbedded in a conductor has no flux, but the external end does.
I liked the electric flux portion of the lecture this week. I liked reading the diagrams and solving for the charge in the example with the box.
I find it interesting that such a complex value like flux can be measured by a dot product and not a more complicated calculus method.
I found GaussIan surfaces pretty interesting since you can draw a shape and then make solving Gauss' law easier to solve.
I found out that Gauss's law is just flux over an imaginary shape, like a potato. I think this helped clear up much of my confusion.","I really like the flux topic. The concept questions about these were something that I found relatively easy to answer after watching the lecture videos in advance.

"n/a
Much was very thorough and clear. I had some issues understanding the diagrams at first, not sure why. Seems a few others were confused with how to interpret the diagram as well. Nevertheless, it was a good self problem solving period. and when the prof explained, it was clear and well executed. I understood more being confused and then being enlightened and shown how the diagram was supposed to represent the particles and their charges. furthermore, after the first diagram it seemed like I felt I was absorbing s a lotmore from the concepts you were trying to get through to us.
The idea of grounding was unclear to me. I did not understand how charge can be left over in a particle after it has been grounded.
Overall, today's class was really good! I thought that each tophat question was well explained. I was a little confused with some of the math steps you took in simplifying, because you never showed any conversions, but the whole concept was clear.
I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me.","In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works.
What I found unclear was the lightbulb lighting up due to the work done by the professor. It was stated that the work done caused the lightbulb to light up and the electrons moving into the lightbulb.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem.
The idea of grounding was unclear to me. I did not understand how charge can be left over in a particle after it has been grounded.
I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value."
"I liked the alien and spaceship top hat question that depends on your reference and how it can relate to being in a car.
I love the conceptual topics of Newton's Laws. I especially found tension interesting.
I found the tension problems to be the most interesting because I was able to understand them more after the lecture.
The tension problems, especially the part with all the salami.
The tug of rope scenario. This was interesting because the tension between the two pullers depends on both not just the stronger one.","I found most of the top hat questions interesting and I feel like they help solidify the concepts that we are going over
I found the tension problems to be the most interesting because I was able to understand them more after the lecture.
I found inertial reference frames most interesting in this lecture and how they compare to non inertial reference frames.
free body diagrams make sense to me because it is easy to draw the lines and i am familiar with them already
I found Newton's first law very interesting. Being able to apply real life experiences such as car travel to physics is fun."
"The applications of payback periods and capital investment could have been covered more.
The most confusing part of today's class was trying to determine CO2 emissions and natural gas for the library.  Trying the determine the amount of coal required to produce enough energy was confusing as there are multiple conversions you need to do before you get to the right value.
I feel like everything in class today was very straightforward. The economic calculations seemed very easy to me and I can understand it pretty well.
Nothing was confusing in today's class.
The equation was confusing a little bit.","Some of the requirements on the A13 pdf were a little confusingattimes. I was confused on what information I needed and where to putit. ATA was very helpful in explaining what I needed to do.

"I think that the professors and PTs did a good job explaining the projects and the due dates.
Excel graphs
Seeing which types of plots were used for different sets of data was interesting.
I did find interesting the different reasons to use different graphs and the graphic you used will be very helpful.
The formatting of the graphs in excel was interesting. I learned a lot about how to use the program.","The most interesting thing in todays class was learning more about what charts are the most appropriate during certain situations.
The opportunity to learn about other engineering careers was interesting
Getting to know my engineering team on a better basis was definitely the most interesting part of class. Spending more time in breakout rooms would be helpful.
I felt like I really learned a lot in class today, especially what makes a good client statement.
I found interesting/important how the professor explained things on bright space and upcoming due dates."
"I didn't find the class today confusing. Everything was explained specifically and helpfully. I found the class to be interactive and helped me to understand what will be required to succeed in the class.
Everything was clear in today's lecture. Instructions were clear, explanations were clear as well.
There was nothing confusing in the class as it was the first. I think the BikeShare project was given sufficient detail and I feel like I can complete it nicely.
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved.
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction","I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time.
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction
The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR
Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments"
"I found the time being able to work on the Assignment with my group to be the most helpful and interesting. It is super helpful to have time to work on the project while everyone is in the class and motivated to work on the Assignment.
The different roles of problem scoping and how it helps engineers when finding solutions to problems was very interesting.
I think the project we started will be a fun and interesting way to see how much we've improved over the course of this semester.

The design project seems interesting, and I am excited to come up with a solution with my team.","I found the time being able to work on the Assignment with my group to be the most helpful and interesting.
I like the design process a lot more than tables and calculation.
I really enjoyed the project prompt that we were given because I thought there are some really interesting ways to solve the problem
I found the problem scoping part to be most interesting as I understand now how useful it is to engineering.
I think the fact that we are coming up with a solution that could improve campus is interesting because of how relevant it is to us as students."
"The class was well explained it helpful as it gave helpful insight on what and when to look for in terms of Homework and Quizzes.
Why we use line plots over scatter plots
The slides on the career exploration was a little confusing.
Thought class was good, I was a bit confused when we were going over the sign up sessions.
Today's class felt pretty straightforward.  Since the in-class assignment was relatively easy to finish you could have possibly made the breakout rooms for that part shorter.","The slides on the career exploration was a little confusing
Exactly where assignments need to be submitted was a little confusing, as well as the naming scheme for certain assignments.
The only thing that maybe could use more clarification is how andwherewe will be signing up for the engineering discipline classes
Why we use line plots over scatter plots
It's a little confusing navigating Brightspace to find everything."
"Solar panel specs
I found my environmental footprint interesting.
I thought that the carbon footprint calculator was very interesting.
I found how engineers have to take ethics into consideration with things like climate change interesting. I also found the different slides showing glaciers and ice melting very interesting. The contrast was something I was not expecting in the pictures shown during class.
The most interesting part of class was working through assignment 13 with my group.","I thought that the most interesting thing in today's class was figuring out your carbon footprint. I did not know it before today and so thought it was nice to learn about.
The most interesting part of class was working through assignment 13 with my group.
I found it very interesting that we got to find the amount of CO2 that our cars emit, it's nice to know what impact we have on theenvironment
I enjoyed the long amounts of time we had to work as a team on the assignment
I found the many ways to view trade-offs and the different ethical points that need to be considered to be the most interesting part of today's class."
"The class wasn't confusing today. The only part of the class that I found somewhat confusing was the In-Class Assignment. The directions were relatively straightforward but slightly confusing based off how they were conveyed.
it was somewhat confusing how broad the project is, and its confusing as far as what we need to turn in for this friday
The problem statement that we wrote for the in class activity was confusing because I wasn't sure at first what we were writing it about. It took a while for me to figure out it was about the assignment 16.
I was confused about the quiz over Module 32 because I checked before class and the quiz was not available until class started so I missed this assignment.
The assignment 16 expectations were confusing because there were conflicting messages in different places in brightspace. This needed clarification.","The part of A16 where we are tasked to come up with questionsandresponses is confusing because of the little amount of time we havetogain actual answers.
It was confusing on how to find the full project document because it wasn't in the same place as it was for other people.
what is needed for the first part of the assignment was inconsistent
I was confused about the document and the specific tasks we needed to complete by next class
I was confused about the quiz over Module 32 because I checked beforeclass and the quiz was not available until class started so I missedthis assignment."
"the power equation and its variables
I was a little confused on the in class activity, but after talking to my group I was able to figure it out!
Todays class should have noted that we can make up the shape of the reservoir container
I don't think I had any questions or felt confused during today's class.
I was confused about how to go about finding the two mathematical models for the taum Sauk tank because i didn't know where to find the lengths","This class wasnt very confusing, but the part where we went overformulas for finding perimiter of the shapes was somewhat confusing.

I was a little confused on how to work a part of the purdue library and google scholar.
I was confused on when we start A11 because it said we started it today in class however I didn't see A11 in 4A Assignments started in class and on the last slide about due dates it said A11 is due at the beginning of 5B","The due date of Assignment 10 and the information needed to complete it.
I think that APA citing resources could have been covered more to get a better understanding of how to cite APA and where to have sources cited.
How much detail is needed on these peer evaluations??
Today's class was pretty clear. The discussion about how reservoirs work could have been clearer to help us better understand the process of how the energy is harvested.
the new project"
"A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful.
Excel is still confusing to use.
I believe class today was very informative. There were definitely some question about histograms that I had answered.
I'm confused on how to find overflow/underflow values.
I had issues using excel with my Mac, couldn't find the bins option when making a histogram. I've been having similar problems while doing other assignments.","A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful.
The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped.
I wish we saw the slide you were talking about that had al the due dates so we didn't have to find it later
The underflow and overflow was confusing for the bins.
The instructions for the in class assignment wasn't posted in the chat until near the end of the breakout room. This made the assignment difficult to complete."
"Nothing needed more clarification. I understood all of the material and believed it to be quite simple
The energy division for the assignment needs better clarification because we need specific values for the usage.
I was a little bit confused initially on how to solve the in class example. I think I must've missed a slide on it from before but I quickly figured it out. My team and I are having a rough start to the A13 project; we are finding step 4 a little bit confusing or tedious.
Nothing was confusing or needed more explaining in today's lecture. The expectations for the group projects was made clear and how groups should approach such project questions was also explained well.
The way to do the problem in excel","Just for me personally, I had a hard time calculating thecapitalinvestment, but when you showed the slide on how to do it, ithelpedclarify some of my confusion
Something that was confusing in today's class was what apaybackperiodmeant. I wasn't sure if it was and actually length of time,oranamount of money per time. But I figured it out.
I think the environmental analysis will prove to be confusing for class 8A.
The equation was mostly explained but the excel portion was a little confusing
The energy division for the assignment needs better clarification because we need specific values for the usage."
"I enjoyed discussing z scores and how they can be used to calculate probability. This is a very useful and practical skill that can be applied in many ways. It is nice to have a class which goes over how to use them and apply them.
I found that being able to convert any sort of distribution to a normal distribution was interesting.
Calculating z values
z-scores can help to find probability of certain events.
Skittle activity was fun to do.","Learning how to use the z score and putting it in practice
It was interesting how we can use the bell curve graphs to talk about probability.
I found the skittles to be a fun and interesting example of how to use our skills to actually do something.
It was interesting to learn more about histograms and how they can be used
I enjoyed working with my group to complete the assignments because we got to work together and finish the work as a group"
"It was interesting/nice to be able to have a lot of time to work on A12, it was also nicer that my group had actually already done A12 before on accident.
It was interesting to know how flow rate could be derived from our original graphs of flow volume throughout the day.
I liked how we had enough class time to really get into A12 and divide out the work. Our team now has a good foundation for completing this assignment.
I found A12 interesting and I am looking forward to working on it with my team. It's interesting because we are analyzing the reservoir's functionality for a specific day.
I found it really interesting that you can use slope to calculate the rate at which water is entering and exiting the upper reservoir. It's cool that this is a real world application of mathematics.","I liked how we had enough class time to really get into A12 and divide out the work.

The topics for the quiz and exam."
"Something interesting was the quiz in class, I enjoyed it and think I did well.
I thought the video about the beetle research was very interesting. It was cool to see some research happening on campus.
I enjoyed the class, however, most of the time was spent working in breakout rooms or on the quiz. I did not find anything incredibly interesting during this class.
The methods for generating ideas are very interesting because they are going to be useful throughout engineering.
I enjoyed learning about the biomimicry of beetle shells used to make very strong force resistant shells.","Something I found most interesting in today's class was the usage ofnature to create solutions to design problems. It feels like a veryunique and interesting way to approach a solution to a problem.
The prompt for the quiz was interesting.
What I found most interesting about today's class was howmuchprocessing goes into just brainstorming ideas that will then be usedtocreate a solution.

"unclear how much needs to be done for background information because it seems like it could be an extremely large and time-consuming section.
How to incorperate stakeholders into the project.
We were confused about finding certain documents for the assignments but we eventually found them.
The only confusing part about todays class was determining the criteria and constraints for the problem statement in the in class activity
Nothing was confusing or hard in today's class. It was pretty straightforward and smooth. No technological errors or other difficulties. It was somewhat hard","I found the difference between problem scoping and what we have been doing in each of the previous assignments confusing because the difference isn't really clear to me. As I read deeper into the assignment I hope this will be cleared up.
Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day.
Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial.
One thing that was confusing about today's class was do you account for criteria that isn't stated by the client in the problem statement or just in the table for criteria and constraints?
I would've appreciated more time spent on how we are expected to empathize with different users. For online students like me it is unclear how we are expected to empathize with many different users when we aren't on campus and also when we don't know a large amount of people who live on or around campus."
"It was interesting to see how going over the pros and cons for an idea can change designs.
I enjoyed the idea of the in class activity despite the poor topic. It was good practice in determining pros and cons.
This whole design project really appeals to me and I'm excited to draw out the sketches for my group.
Going over what we should do in assignment 17 was extremely helpful to my team. We would have done the assignment incorrectly if we hadn't gone over the assignment expectations in class.
I found idea generation with my team interesting.","I liked the evaluation of pros/cons of the costumer service. I think maybe you could give us questions to think about if we need to further evaluate pros/cons for any project
I found the advice on how to do the activity incredibly helpful. My team was wrongly doing the activity, and without the clarification likely would have turned it in without meeting the requirements.
The breakout room was very help because our team was able to finalize our ideas for A17 and also get Jeff Hall's input! He was extremely helpful and now we're finished with the assignment.
I enjoyed coming up with ideas and thought it was interesting to see how my teamates thoughts varied.
I was interested in seeing the evaluations that engineers use and how it was useful for us to make sure that the decisions made were the best one suited as the solution."
"Today's class was little confusing and I didn't need any extra details.
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes.
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype","We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to ourseparation.
How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one.
The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment.
I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
Thinking of prototypes while most of our ideas had to do with the road was confusing"
"I found the carbon footprint information confusing because I was not sure how to take the environmental data from A13 and reflect a carbon footprint.
I was a little bit confused about how the in class activity related to the environmental analysis. I understand that we need to find the CO2 emissions in the economic analysis, but I don't understand how the equation we used for the in class activity should be used in the environmental analysis.
I didn't find much to be confusing, it was mainly an explanation of trade offs and climate change, along with work time.
We were unsure of why the density of gasoline was included on the slide about the calculations for the participation's other than to try to trip us up.
I thought that more details could have been given about the individual effects of climate change.","The carbon emissions calculation was a little confusing because I didn't understand where the numbers were coming from at first.
I was confused about the in class activity at first but when I discussed it with my group we figured it out.
There wasn't much confusing work to do the only thing I can think of to be confusing was why we were giving the density of gasoline in our in class activity.
More details about how to calculate the 3 year payback period
I found the portion of the lecture on assumptions to be a little confusing, as it isn't made too clear the difference between an assumption and data that just isn't reliable."
"What was confusing about this class, was how are we supposed to know if to include something we think is a  constraint is one for the company too?
The expectations for Assignment 10 were very unclear. During our studio time it took us a very long time to understand what exactly was ""due"" on the technical brief.
Today, I thought that the instructions for assignment 10 were confusing, especially involving the mathematical modeling for the project.
I was confused around the in class activity. How do you find peer reviewed or reliable sources on more general information. All papers seem to be on specific topics.
Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams.","Something that needed more detail in today's class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10).
What was a bit confusing was the source searching part of class.
It would be helpful to have more details about the Sauk project and what we need to do for each milestone.

Can other strategies be taken for that problem, such as using the definition of a conditional statement to say true implies false is the only way it can overall be false?
