"Using the charges and electric field to calculate torque
The experiment when when could see the diopole, and the whole concept of polar molecules like water.
In today's class, I found it interesting that electric fields work how wind works. I learned that wind has many vectors as does electric fields.
The fact that water can suspend in midair due to electric fields!

"The initial set up. Specifically the limits of integration and the variable of integration.
Some of the Calc concepts needed some review before I could fully apply them to Physics.
Determining when to use cos or sin for integration of a ring of charge. Also drawing dE vectors along the z-axis was a bit confusing for me.
The class problem regarding finding the x component of Electric field.
I am somewhat confused on what dq/ds represent in the problems in parts 3/4 of this lecture series.","The ring of charge section was the most confusing. Setting it up and finding E parallel and E perpendicular was the most confusing for me
While I understand the solving the integral process, I could use more clarity/examples of setting up integrals in different situations. Also, a deeper explanation of what exactly is happening to the electric field when influenced by an extended charge.
I felt the lecture was going too fast and felt that we should go over details more rather than flying through each tophat question.
I am really having trouble setting up integrals for the electric field. I don't understand how to set it up given the linear density and the charge.
The initial set up. Specifically the limits of integration and the variable of integration."
"Batteries and circuits are intriguing. I like to learn about currents and how energy within batteries work
The circuit analysis about the voltage in loops summing to 0.
I found the ammeters and voltmeters interesting because they can both be used in the same circuit but for different reasons.
The grounding was very interesting.
i thought that the applications of grounding and how that could simplify complicated circuits was interesting","The amount of info we can determine from a simple circuit with proper analysis is very cool.
I thought grounding was interesting. I never understood what grounding meant before.
I found the ammeters and voltmeters interesting because they can both be used in the same circuit but for different reasons.
i liked that no matter which path you took to find current in a circuit, you'll get the same value.
I found it interesting using the loop rule to solve the last problem because it made the problem more simple than I initially thought."
"I was confused with the partial integrals, as I have never seen those before. Also, when there are multiple charges, some of the calculations become less clear.
one thing that was confusing for me was the actual calculations regarding the topic. I was a bit confused on that part of the concept quiz.
Calculating cylindrical capacitors
The difference between the two variables that use U was very confusing. How energy relates to capacitance just wasn't clear to me.
I am not sure what the difference between u and v is. They seem to be interchangeable?","one thing that was confusing for me was the actual calculations regarding the topic. I was a bit confused on that part of the concept quiz.

In video 2, why did U and V start at the same place?
In today's class I found it confusing how the units work between charge and capacitance and electric potential. I found it confusing what a farad is."
"I was a little confused about the last example in lecture for finding the voltage in each resistor because I wasn't sure how the amps split in the circuit
Re-drawing and simplifying circuits is still a bit confusing
I think find emf and voltage difference could be gone over a little more. Maybe an example with a diagram instead of graph would benefit us more conceptually
Resistors
The group problems","It wasn't confusing, but I think going over Ohm's law and when you can and can't use it would be helpful
I found resistors in series fairly confusing just because I find myself getting tripped up with how to add voltage in the series.
I thought the examples at the end of the cuvids for the first set were a little confusing, I wasn't sure how the equations were derived
the relationship between the internal voltage of a battery vs. the external voltage.
Trying to figure out if things are in series or parallel"
"The current density was the most confusing for me because I was just a bit confused on how to set up the integral.
Series capacitors and resistance
I thought that it was a little confusing why in the 1st example you performed you added the non matching capacitance (C3) with C2 and plugged that into the expression. and on our sapling concept quiz, we instead used expression (C1*C2)/(C1+C2)+ C3.  why were we allowed to do that for that problem and not this one? genuinely confused.
I was confused about how you know when capacitors are in parallel with each other.
I'm having trouble conceptualizing and visualizing these topics so examples and explanations of concepts would help. Also, how is electric current/density acts in insulators","I'm a little confused on how charge is distributed on capacitors in series vs capacitors in parallel.

I was confused about how you know when capacitors are in parallel with each other.
The only thing I felt was kind of confusing was charge density. In lecture, you said that current density and the electric field went in opposite directions and I found that slightly perplexing.
The current density was the most confusing for me because I was just a bit confused on how to set up the integral."
"I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
I enjoyed when we got to work on the problem in groups of 4. It allowed for discussion between classmates.
I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I liked the way the professor described vector addition as adding a negative vector. I have never been taught i that way, and it makes vector subtraction much easier.
I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on.","I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy tofollow.
I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged inpractice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
I enjoyed using Top Hat because it kept me active during the lesson."
"When using gravity in equations for free body diagrams, why is it represented a positive instead of negative?
The problem that involved the man pulling himself up on a pulley was difficult to understand.  If the man is pulling down with the same force as the tension, shouldn't that cancel out one of the tensions ?
In today's lecture, I was bit confused by the free body diagram of friction. How would friction change if the normal force was at an angle to the horizontal?
The last example we did in class. My group overthought it and then the solution was so simple.
I was confused about the relation of the force when the rope was pulled down on the pulley. It was also unclear where the equations we used in the problems derived from.","The problem that involved the man pulling himself up on a pulley was difficult to understand.  If the man is pulling down with the same forceas the tension, shouldn't that cancel out one of the tensions ?
The top hat problem with the 3 blocks. We covered this towards the end, and as we were crunched for time, I thought the problem wasn't discussed as much as I would've liked.
In today's lecture, I was bit confused by the free body diagram of friction. How would friction change if the normal force was at an angle to the horizontal?
The fact of there being two tensions confused me for one of the first questions we did. I didn't quite get the 2T, but I think I understand it now after it was explained.
Force magnitudes when there are multiple masses such as a person pushing on three rocks. It's just sometimes confusing on which masses to add or the exact forces acting on the masses."
"I think the weighted decision matrix needed more explanation on how the numbers worked. Otherwise I understood today's class
Everything sounded good.
The WDM was a little confusing. I was confused with the xsl file format. And the text towards the bottom.
The whole setup behind a weighted matrix is still confusing to me, and i do not see a significant benefit behind it yet
I was very confused about the in class activity. I watched the module video but I didn't feel that we talked about making these models a lot until after we did the in-class activity.","The due date of assignment 18 was confusing
I was a little confused about what to put as the metrics in the weighted decision matrix at first.
Part of the decision matrix discussion was a little confusing on all of the different aspects that were needed in parts one, two, and three.
I was a little confused on how to choose my criteria for the in class activity.
I wasn't completely sure about what to do for the in class activity because the template had a lot of slots to fill out but we only had todo some of it, but it wasn't completely clear about what parts we were supposed to do."
"How to use regression lines for excel
The class was a good class. There wasn't anything particularly interesting but at the same time there wasn't anything boring. I enjoyed the amount of time we were given to work with our groups near the end.

"Using excel is still very confusing.
I found z-scores and talking about standard deviation and area under the curve confusing. I'm not sure what it all represents and how to use those numbers to interpret data
Nothing has the chance to be confusing because every class is simply a rehash of the modules, with no new content. It is simply tedious.
I believe in today's lecture they probably could've been a better instruction on the fact that only one person had to submit the skittles data. Therefore we would be about to do all of our assignment right away.
I was confused on what what our in class participation was for 3b. I wasn't sure if we needed to submit anything or not.","The directions for the skittles activity in class were sort of confusing at first, but our team figured out what needed to be done
Assignment 08 was confusing because the directions were not clear. I had my hand raised in the breakout room and no one came.
I didn't quite fully grasp what z tables were and how do we figure out what values to use for funding the numbers
The formulas that we went over today are somewhat confusing to me. Other than that I thought class was very good!

I was confused on the feedback part of assignment 17. I was not really sure where the feedback was coming from. After my team and I talked to my TA it was a lot clearer!
The most confusing part of today was figuring out where and who we would be getting feedback from.  Since we didn't have feedback yet we were confused what we should use for part 5.
It was confusing what part V was supposed to resemble and what iteration #1 meant. It was confusing that there was no explanation for this assignment.
Some of the specific things about A17 like how many ideas we need and the stuff Jeff mentioned at the end being brought up for the first time.","How much of The iteration we are supposed to do for A17

There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.","I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation. I could relatively understand it but I could not explain what it is used for. Hopefully some confusions could be cleared next class.
The most confusing thing was calculating the regression constant value.
The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end.

Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times. We are still unclear on how to draw the visual models using the Laminar Approach. I believe that going over the Laminar Approach and doing an example would be extremely beneficial to all teams.","Something that needed more detail in today's class is the specific parts of the assignment (A10).

How do we approximate the surface area at various depths without information on the geometry of the reservoir?
I thought that the instructions for the mathematical models were misleading. The slides and our TA cleared that up and clarified to just use 2D shapes.
The power equation was kind of confusing. I was mostly confused on how to find each variable, however, I am not sure if this equation will be utilized later in the course.
I may have just missed it, however, I did find it confusing how to use the percent grade to calculate the height of the pipe in the in class activity. Nevertheless, one of the PT guys was able to clear this up and help me with the issue. I was just making it too complicated.","Creating models was definitely confusing and could use more explanations in the future. I felt like I need additional guidance finding the best approach when trying to create a model and how to improve models to make it the best possible.
The thing that was confusing today was trying to figure out a mathematical model that fit the slope change of the reservoir. It was confusing because it is difficult to picture a function that would map all of this information.

The assignments are very vague. The individual assignments are pretty straightforward but the team ones are super confusing sometimes.
The overall approach to the reservoir's laminar approach was confusing, especially with the example of the graph and trendline. It was a bit vague.
I am still slightly confused on the purpose of finding the overall slope of the data. I know this can help find trends but am confused how this will help with scattered data. Overall, I get the process of it but found the purpose of it confusing.","Simple linear regression needed more details, especially as it relates to what the r squared value does.

The taum sauk reservoir calculations were interesting because seeing how simple the calculation for power is is very cool.","The thing I found most important in today's class is that the mathematical model doesn't have to be specific to one answer and is based on the preference of the person making it. However, such preferences can alter the accuracy of the calculations made based on the model.
I found the part where we were applying the power equation and information to the Taum Sauk project with our group interesting
The group time was plenty of time for my group to be efficient and work on assignment 10

the different situations in which mean, median, and mode were applied as the average.
Learning how to apply various filters and manipulate pivot tables was very informative and will probably be useful in completing the Bikeshare assignment.
I found it interesting how to find outliers in the data.

We were confused about finding certain documents for the assignments but we eventually found them.
The only confusing part about todays class was determining the criteria and constraints for the problem statement in the in class activity
Nothing was confusing or hard in today's class. It was pretty straightforward and smooth. No technological errors or other difficulties. It was somewhat hard","I found the difference between problem scoping and what we have been doing in each of the previous assignments confusing because the difference isn't really clear to me. As I read deeper into the assignment I hope this will be cleared up.
Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day.
Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial.
One thing that was confusing about today's class was do you account for criteria that isn't stated by the client in the problem statement or just in the table for criteria and constraints?
I would've appreciated more time spent on how we are expected to empathize with different users. For online students like me it is unclear how we are expected to empathize with many different users when we aren't on campus and also when we don't know a large amount of people who live on or around campus."
"I enjoyed discussing z scores and how they can be used to calculate probability. This is a very useful and practical skill that can be applied in many ways. It is nice to have a class which goes over how to use them and apply them.

I didn't understand how to format the histogram axis in excel. Excel automatically adjusts bin width and bin numbers
The part of class that was confusing was how to find bin width. Or more of once you find it do you need to round it up or to the nearest whole number?
It is difficult for mac users to submit assignments and edit in excel so more information on how to do assignments would be helpful.
I did not understand how exactly to set the correct bi  width and number in excel for mac. Everytime I place the calculated values, the ranges do not equal whole numbers.","The only part of today's class was being able to identify the type of data.
I am still a little bit unclear on how to work some of the aspects on excel including changing the axis value on a Mac.
How to know what data representation method to chose given data.
For A07, I am confused on how we customize the bin widths AND number of bins.

I found the rocket equation that was in the homework problem was very interesting. I want to go into aerospace engineering, and so it was cool to see real engineering equations in class.
The question using the equation to find delta v was pretty interesting and it gave me a short look at a part of what engineering students do in AAE.
The use of Excel was not something I was anticipating would be a major part of my engineering education, but makes sense when I put some thought into it.

Translating English sentences into propositional sentences was confusing. It was kind of unclear how implications translated.
I think the professor should give more examples on translating from English to logic because I am still not clear on how he can assign the connectives to each piece.

The most confusing part of todays class was why the if statement was needed in the while loop. I think it would have been beneficial to go over the reasoning for that again.
Flowcharts of nested loops, specifically tips for reading and interpreting them."
"Nested loops
I think that todays class was pretty clear and the in class activity reaffirmed what I thought. A10s practice also follows through with this.
I was confused by the directions of A10, Question 2. There were a lot of aspects to each UDF that we needed to create.
What was confusing was what to label the main function like the title of the matlab file because the UDF file needs to be the same name as the function but can the main function be anything?
I felt like there were not enough nested loop problems in the class slides. Additionally, I needed more practice on this.","One thing that needed more details was A10 question 2. Directions on how to solve the second question would be very helpful.

Today, I was a little confused on the details of abstraction. I think out of the four we learned it was the most confusing for me. I think the part that threw me off the most was the examples we used. To elaborate, the example in class seemed straight forward, but class examples were different that caused confusion for myself. In class, I understood the stick people analogy, and think I needed just a few more to really grasp the concept.
A think a bit more information on each of the different types, why are each so important
Very clear in speech and used many examples to help explain concepts. However, there was some confusing regarding the distinction between algorithms and abstraction.
Most if not everything was covered thoroughly and clearly. I don't believe I have any confusing or pressing questions."
"It was interesting how varied the amount of steps were for making a paper airplane. Different levels of specificity were displayed
The applications of computational thinking throughout history. It is very cool to see the process applied to real-world changes.
The algorithms used in real life were fun.
I found interesting that there are 4 types of computation and that computation is not only computers but about human thinking.
I found the concept of human computations interesting. I also enjoy using Tophat.","The paper plane activity and taking into consideration what you consider steps and what is unnecessary to include in the 5 step process.
Hearing the history of German cryptography
I enjoyed discussing the process of how both humans and computers compute, especially how each has their own strengths, such as the emotions and wisdom of humans compared to the mathematical and calculating computers.
I though the idea that we don't need computers to compute was cool. The different levels and processes that go into computing were also interesting.

"I couldn't hear anything from the zoom meeting, so I'm sure I missed quite a bit. I don't know if the ica is a group activity, and if it is, I don't have a good way to contact my team. I also don't know what my team number is.
I think the way to use if statements was confusing.
I think it might be better to talk more about what should we do during the breakout room. Since it took awhile for our team to get what we should submit today, and planing for our rest homework.
I had difficulties using if and elseif and else function in MATLAB.
The original concept of the if statement and else was confusing at first, but when it was explained and the examples were shown it made more sense. With more practice I understood it.","I had difficulties using if and elseif and else function in MATLAB.
The instructions for the in class activity were a little confusing at first
I was confused on some of the input commands and how to operate them after typed out.
assignment A08
I was confused on inputting values in the command window. As soon as I realized how easy it was I felt much better."
"i was confused about how to update my variable for the while loop
There was no in person class but there was a picture video instead. No parts of video confused me and I actually liked having a video to watch and as much time as you needed to do the work rather tba. having everything have an allotted amount of time already. I prefer the flexibility this way.
I thought that the video did a good job of explaining the content. But sometimes he used functions inside of matlab that I was unfamiliar with so it made it more difficult.
I am confused on whether or not we still need to turn in the in class assignment to grade scope.
Whether while loops can be considered as selection structures or not. Different ways of ending while loops.","Whether while loops can be considered as selection structures or not. Different ways of ending while loops.

"Using selection structures and the input function to create programs. It is interesting because we can make interactive programs now.
I found the ifelse loops the most entertaining and very useful for any future projects I undertake involving decision making.
I really enjoyed meeting my team today.
The most interesting part always be knowing teammates and working together. It is a lot of fun and I think we can even have classes that we work together the entire time.
As I learned how to use if elseif and else function, I was able to know it is hard, but also interesting.","I found the ifelse loops the most entertaining and very useful for any future projects I undertake involving decision making.

I found the logical operators the most interesting because they have so many applications

i thought it was interesting how you can use the script to find out text displays for different values."
"I had some confusion on the order of operations in Matlab before class, so it would have been nice to go into more detail regarding that.
The last in class activity was co fusing at first since some of the matrix data was.missing so I didn't know what to answer as you couldnt a swerve the question fully since some of the data was missing but I learned afterwards that it was asking for the command not the answer even though the other questions needed answers.
I was confused on the default layout of matlab. My matlab has separated my script and my command tabs to separate pages and I am confused how to put it back.
I think I need more practice with making a truth table. I was also struggling to predict the outcomes of logical operators.
What was confusing in class today was the logical operator xor and felt like it could used some more detail since and and or operators are more common throughout programming.","I think I need more practice with making a truth table.

I found the third part of the in class activity as to what the variables represented.

I was confused for the components that I need to put for my plots for asssignment 06. I'm was not 100% sure about if I'm following the instructions correctly or not.
The difference between sgtitle and title for making titles for graphs. It can be confusing because some of the commands used are not applicable for both."
"I was confused about where to find the in class activity.
i was confused as to why my readmatrix function was not allowing me to import the data file. it turns out that i needed to open the folder that the data file was in within the current folder.
It was confusing to tell what to do when Professor Wible is over zoom.
I think that the array indexing is still confusing. I do not understand how to select values from only a row or a column
The idea of creating multiple figures in one plot was pretty confusing to me. I was also confused about the components that I need to put in my plots.","How to display figures were confusing, specifically how you were to separate the figures so it didn't just display all 3 figures from A06 together on the same graph. The subplot counting was weird how it was the opposite of linear indexing but it was covered well so that worked out in the end.
The idea of creating multiple figures in one plot was pretty confusing to me. I was also confused about the components that I need to put in my plots.
It was confusing partly because I was on zoom so flipping back and forth between my brightpsace and zoom and Matlab is tricky.

For our 3A activity, I had difficulty understanding the graph. Whether the Y axis represented the VOC emissions from the production of the Subarus or from the exhaust from the actual cars."
