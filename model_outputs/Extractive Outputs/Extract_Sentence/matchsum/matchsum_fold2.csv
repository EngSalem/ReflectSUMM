"The conservation of energy question was very tricky. I was indecisive between the correct answer and the “difference in charge” answer, so I felt that I learned the most from this question.
I found it interesting how similar electric force is to gravitational force.
I found the demonstration done to show the lightbulb lighting was very interesting because of the separation of charges.
What I found most interesting today was that there can be two components of an electrostatic force. I found this interesting because  I'm working with forces that are invisible.
Electric charge properties","I thought the demonstration with the lightbulb was fun to watch. It gave me a visual representation of what was happening.
i really like learning about the electric charges and i like learning about electrons after taking so many chemistry classes
Energy conservation in particle physics with a gamma ray photon being split into an electron and positron was very intriguing since I've never learned much about gamma rays in the past.
I found it interesting how similar electric force is to gravitational force.
The amount of interaction we were able to have with you as an instructor and in breakout rooms was interesting."
"Cramer's rule and matrices
the differential equation portion involving RC circuits was a little confusing. Another example would be very much helpful for a lot of us I think.
The loops were very confusing.
I was confused on how to solve for matrices and determinants using my calculator.
Concept quiz 16 question 1 was confusing, why do you add the voltages?","Concept quiz 16 question 1 was confusing, why do you add the voltages?
the differential equation portion involving RC circuits was a little confusing. Another example would be very much helpful for a lot of us I think.
I was a bit confused with the loop rule and multi loop circuits. I had trouble on the concept quiz so I think seeing some more examples being solved would help me.
I was confused about how to use a calculator to solve matrices.
I find the orientation of magnetic fields very confusing. I'm not sure how to tell if it should be pointing in or out of the page, why it is always in the positive or negative k direction, or how it affects which direction a particle will circle in."
"The planar electric field being constant
The return of the shell theorem to explain a more complicated concept
the different types of symmetry
I like the derivation process because you can get answers for any shape.
Today's lecture was very interesting. It showed how Gaussian symmetry in different shapes were similar.","The planar electric field being constant
Today's lecture was very interesting. It showed how Gaussian symmetry in different shapes were similar.
I think it's interesting how the shell theorem can be used in physics
I found it neat and helpful that drawing a Gaussian surface around or through certain objects with uniform surface charge makes finding E on the object much easier. However knowing how to orient the Gaussian surface seems a bit difficult in some situations.
I thought this concept was easy to grasp. The videos did a great job of helping me picture the scenarios."
"The rc circuit stuff
It's interesting how the current of an RC circuit is essentially a fraction of the original current dependant on the time constant.
I enjoy learning about magnets, their properties and their fields
Magnetic field lines and  multiloop circuits
I found it interesting that magnetic fields are so similar to electric fields.","It's interesting how the current of an RC circuit is essentially a fraction of the original current dependant on the time constant.
I found the magnetic field lines interesting because no matter how small they get they will always have a north and a south end.
I found the balloon tophat question most interesting about today's class because I thought too hard about it at first and once it was explained it was an “ah” moment
I really enjoyed writing the circuit equations in terms of one another and then forming differential equations. On top of already enjoying this unit, I really like this kind of math as well
I really like that magnetic field lines follow the same rules as electric field lines. I also like that magnetic monopoles haven't been discovered!"
"The multiple ways/ equations possible to find the same answer.
Right hand rule! Today is finally clicked for me and I was able to better understand the concept.
Top hat
Seeing the right hand rule explained live was very helpful and I liked the toy car demo.
End questions","The right-hand rule was very interesting for me because it is something I've never seen in action before. I was a little confused about it during the reading, but what was talked about in class helped me to get the hang of what it's all about.
I really liked the description of the graphs between acceleration, velocity, and displacement. I've had trouble with them in the past but I feel like I have a good understanding now.
I found the live demonstration interesting. It is always useful to see physics happening in real life. It makes all the work seem real and obtainable. We can forget that all this math has real applications.
I really enjoyed the top hat question with the negative cosine angle, causing the dot product to be negative even though it was scalar. I go the question incorrect but I liked how it was explained and Ilearned a lot from it.
I thought the explanations of dot and cross products were interesting because they helped me understand the concepts better."
"I found the conceptual questions that go along with free fall interesting. I like the concept of gravity being constant acceleration.
I like projectile motion from my high school physics class so when this video lecture began to talk about gravity and free fall, I really enjoyed it.
The dinosaurs (Jurassic park vibes), and the intro to group was interesting, because it gave me an idea of how things will work in the future for quizzes and tophat questions.
The dinosaur problem was most interesting. I enjoyed that it really challenged you to think about how to set the equations equal to each other and which equation to pick.
I enjoyed the conceptual top hat questions during this lecture. These connections brought a true understanding of how kinematics work in real life (neglecting air resistance of course).","The dinosaur problem was most interesting.

understanding and getting the majority of the problems asked in tophat correct. this means that i have some sort of a grasp and understand of the topic we're on.
found the breakout rooms to be the most interesting. Working as a team is always more productive as I was able to hear different approaches to solving the problem."
"There was no video lecture in class as we took the exam. The first problem on the test was a little confusing in the sense that interpreting the time we were supposed to find was difficult.
I guess the test, not sure if my group got it right. Otherwise great experience 7/10 would try again.
Questions were very hard compared to study guide. Studied concepts but could not figure out problems.
Exam was tough. fair. VERY tough
N/A (no class today so nothing was confusing, or more accurately, no lecture was confusing)","There was no video lecture in class as we took the exam. The first problem on the test was a little confusing in the sense that interpreting the time we were supposed to find was difficult.
I felt like the exam was overall pretty good. This first part was a little more confusing than the second for me, although my group mateshad trouble with the second.
Questions were very hard compared to study guide. Studied concepts but could not figure out problems.
thought question 2 was confusing because I wasn't sure what to do with the acceleration exactly because block 2 was heavier than block 1.

"I liked the top hat questions. I feel they are engaging and make it easier to learn material.
top hat questions as they help me not zone out during class
I thought projectile motion was interesting because I learned that vertical and horizontal motions are independent. Although the x component's velocity is constant, the y component's velocity is not.
The monkey experiment is interesting.
The explanation of the truck and baseball pitching machine question.","Definitely the monkey hunting problem. Although I was  confused by thesolution, i was really intrigued by the scenario. It was fascinatingthat the monkey fell right as the golf ball was released, and it madeimpact right before the monkey hit the ground.
I thought that relative motion was the most interesting, since it gives you multiple perspectives.

I liked the breakout rooms. It was interesting to hear the points of other students.
I liked the top hat questions. I feel they are engaging and make it easier to learn material."
"While the most confusing, I found the question about the two blocks hanging from the pulley the most interesting. I also liked the top hat questions because they weren't too hard but not too easy as well.
the information about cold vs. hot welds.
Learning about the relationship between normal force and friction and how friction works and looks molecularly.
The first top hat problem with the 3 blocks and the problem with the sled being pushed and pulled. I was quite fascinated with the answers for both of these.
The coefficient of friction, either static or kinetic, is usually smaller than 1.","I thought learning about the coefficient of friction and how it's proportional to the normal force was interesting.
I found the description of static friction most interesting. I thinkstatic friction is more interesting than kinetic friction because whenstatic friction reaches it's maximum value, any amount of force appliedwill accelerate the object.
Dr. Nero demonstrate how to solve friction problems with 2 body diagrams set up
Learning about the relationship between normal force and friction and how friction works and looks molecularly.
I found learning about how friction was really interesting. It was coolto understand how the cold welds between two surfaces impacted friction."
"The right-hand rule and how to use coordinate plane with just x and z values (as opposed to x and y).
I thought today's lecture was very clear. I appreciated the car demonstration, as well as the Top Hat questions. It helped me stay engaged and better understand the topics covered.
Everything was clear during this lecture. I had no confusion and I understood everything from the clicker questions.
I was quite confused with the x,y,a, axis top hat question. I didnt quite understand the placement of the z axis (axis coming out/into the screen).
i was still a little confused about the position velocity and acceleration graphs. i always get confused when interpreting them. i'll definitely go watch some youtube videos about it but it would go a little more in depth","The right hand rule because I was just a bit confused how to read it or tell when it's pointing in or out of the screen.
The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the endof class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. Weonly talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm surewith more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lotbetter.
How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
the only thing that I would want more details in would be the way an object is 3-D on paper because i still do not get that
Some of the tophat questions lacked directions and made them hard to understand."
"The different applications of FBD to solve problems like the example of the man supporting himself on the pulley system.
drawing free body diagrams to set up equations
The “recipe” for free body diagrams. It made drawing them a lot easier.
The pulley system/elevator problems because I find them very fun to do.
Top hat question where the man on the chair pulls on the rope. I thought it was an interesting real life problem to solve.","The “recipe” for free body diagrams. It made drawing them a lot easier.
Despite this being a difficult concept, i though the man pullinghimself up with a pulley was very interesting, as it shows how pulleyscan be utilized in industry
Redefining the system to make calculations faster by calling several objects the system instead of just one
I find tension interesting. The fact that two things can way down one rope and it's the same tension fascinated me.
I found the top hat questions about normal force to be most interesting"
"I need more clarification about why the acceleration vector points in toward the center.
The most confusing part of the lecture was determining the centripetal force.
Circular force was a bit confusing when dealing with acceleration.
I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes. However, your explanation cleared it up. The application of multiple g's tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g.
Today's lesson was not unclear or confusing. The only thing that could have been explained more in depth is centripetal force.","What was confusing about this lecture was what forces can be considered a centripetal force.  I saw that soletimes it can be the normal force or some other force.
I think it was tough to conceptualize some of the drag force problems. Although it's not going to be a heavy focus for the exam, I would've liked to connect more drag force problems to conceptual ideas.
circular motion was barely even taught, especially the net force portion
the lesson moved really fast for such a complicated topic. deriving the equations was confusing and there weren't enough examples or applications to understand the formulas
I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes. However, your explanation cleared itup. The application of multiple g's tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g."
"I was not confused about anything
The new project specifications
I think the participation work was very vague
Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.","I would like more details about the A13 to be more clear so it's easier to accomplish.
The in-person activity wasn't clear on what needed to be done.
unfortunately we received our grade back for assignment A12 and we were somewhat co fused on how we did not get a higher grade.
Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
I think it would be helpful going a little more over the calculations for energy. I just need help deciding what units to put my calculations in."
"I was confused on whether we did assignment 19 correct or not
Nothing is confused in today's class
The practice exam not having a solution to it
The most confusing part of today's class was when bright space was not working, so it was hard to follow what we were supposed to work on and submit.

I liked meeting up with my teammates and talking about when we should meet up with each other.
What we learned in Excel was really cool when we could figure out what to do.
I found learning how to create graphs to be the most interesting part, and I think the most exciting part was meeting my team.
The excel skills","The youtube video was interesting regarding why diversity is useful when creating new products
I think the Excel stuff is pretty interesting.
I found it very interesting that all of my group members are on campus. We can all meet in person and don't have to worry about different time zones.
I think the filters and pivot tables and pivot charts seem very useful.
The diversity announcement was very intriguing. I liked how it was incorporated and how we touched upon how it relates directly to engineers."
"The new process of analyzing data.
I found it interesting that it is possible to calculate the power generated from water flow.
I liked learning more about the Taum Sauk Reservoir and how it works today

I found it interesting that purdue gives access to lots of tools to help with prototyping.
how to access the cad software
Using CAD in order to create and model prototypes
I enjoyed Jeff's costume","This is a long project, so I like how we're looking back on what we'vedone so far. This may give us a better understanding of how we'll moveforward.
I found all of the different ways to prototype fairly interesting and how many possible sources of evidence there are.
I found interesting how we have a 3D printing club where we couldusetheir resources for our project. Also the amounts of availablesoftwareprograms offered by Purdue.
The time to work with our teams in break out rooms
I liked Jeff's Robin costume."
"It was interesting to research how the Taum Sauk reservoir broke and how much was wrong with it.
I thought it was interesting learning about different engineering failures.
I thought the lecture about past engineering mistakes was really fascinating because I like to see things in real life.
The most interesting part of today's class was learning about engineering failures and looking at historical events which highlighted some of the worst mistakes that led to destruction.
How to learn from engineering mishaps I thought was very interesting. Taking engineering disasters and finding inspiration and knowledge from those I think is very interesting.","I liked seeing the different examples of engineering gone wrong
mathematical modeling is still really interesting problem solving.
The time spent in breakout rooms with my team are super helpful. We areable to get through a lot of project material in the given time.
Working with the power formula
I found it interesting that engineers careless mistakes caused the Taum Sauk failure."
"Excel practice at the end was confusing because we didn't have much time
I was a little confused today when we where downloading the file from online and making it available to use on excel.  I think we could have slowed down there a little bit to make sure all of the students are on the same page and are able to open up the spreadsheet without any errors.
The only thing I found confusing today was the formula input for the gravitational forces calculation. However, I ended up figuring it out by altering the scientific notation cells.
I was very stressed during class because Excel was not working and I felt the time in the break out rooms was too short. Also the data represents measurements was very confusing.
I found it confusing when I tried to download the data sheet to excel. I also was kicked from the zoom call and had trouble getting back in to the call.","I was confused about entering the complex calculations into excel. I haven't used excel in a long time so I think I just need practice.
The problem statement outline was not very helpful and the problem we were asked to find seem very vague.

The only thing I found confusing today was the formula input for the gravitational forces calculation"
"I think what we were supposed to do with the excel document was a little bit confusing.  The directions weren't super specific and I thank the assignment should have been clarified a little better.
Maybe more about the team project? And the bike project too.
The amount of time spent during class explaining the different data types could use some lengthening.
Very little. I would have likes more time spent in the groups, but I assume that we'll get more of that further into the project.
I was lost on the in class excel activity today. I could not figure out how to find the outliers for the birth year.","If you could put the slides on brightspace before the video call itwould be helpful, because then we could have it open and look at them ifwe get lost during a call
I was confused on what the task is for assignment 5 and how we need to use the bike share data to complete the assignment.
I think it was a little confusing for some people when doing theexcelassignment since some people are still getting used to it and youwent alittle fast.

I found interesting how we use nature to come up with ideas.","I liked how we did the quiz in class rather than outside of classbecause I have a lot of other assignments to do for my other classes.
I found the multiple types of inspiration on idea generation to be the most interesting part of today's class.
I found it interesting how our group has to take pictures of our think process and use it for the end product.
I found the ironclad beetle biomimicry segment to be most interesting as I love getting ideas from nature.
the beetle video was really cool"
"I was confused on how to convert units
We have talked about the quiz and test, everything is clear.
There was no in class activity so that was confusing because no one mentioned it. The exam instructions were also a bit confusing.
I did not find anything confusing in today's class.
Nothing was confusing. We just sat in breakout rooms working on the projects.","I found that during the studio time, I was confused as to whether use a constant pressure head or using a changing one that changes based on the height of the upper reservoir.
We could have used some more information about how to prepare for the exam. In other classes I know there are previous exams that we can use to study.
This class was not confusing, but you could have gone over expectations for A12 some more
How the excel will work for the in class quiz
Basically everything made sense today, i never really had any questions but the ones i did were answered when we went into breakout rooms. It would have been nice if we could have done some review on the quiz"

The weighted design matrix was a little confusing
How to set up cad
The most confusing part was when different assignments are due
the consistency between the powerpoints and the doc is bad sometimes"
"I feel like today's class could've used a more in depth explanation of how power is produced, we discussed methods of producing power but not actually how the power was produced.
I was confused on what kind of reaserch would be required outside of the information given to us in the assignment document.
Requirements for A13 are very confusing. Do we need to even use natural gas data/will the library still be heated by natural gas while powered by solar panels? Should we assume that solar panels have 0 carbon emissions, or do we need to take into account the carbon emissions caused by the manufacturing process of those panels?
One thing that was confusing about today's class was are you able to use more than 500 solar panels for the library? Or are we just solely supposed to perform calculations based on the idea that we are using 500 solar panels?
I found nothing to be confusing or unclear in today's class. Everything was explained well and made clear prior to the given work time. Making sure to explain what was needed and expected for the project helped me gain a better understanding before going into it.","I feel like today's class could've used a more in depth explanation of how power is produced, we discussed methods of producing power but not actually how the power was produced.
I was confused on A13 even after reading the instruction on part 4, it included calculations that I didn't understand where we could get the information from.
thought it was confusing when we were trying to figure out what exact calculations we needed to do to do an environmental and economic evaluation
There's no excel file and the memo is rough with info.
I would have liked some more information on the emissions of Solar Panels and the systems currently used in powering the Indianapolis Library."

How probability and z score are related. Also, can we please go over some examples of how to fill in missing data. My team is struggling on question one on assignment 8. Could we go over some examples of how to fill in missing data?
I feel A08 needed more explanation. When we talk in class about assigments ensemble we do that superficially but when we need to work on them on out own or with our team I start to feel a little bit lost.","I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing.
I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while"
"I was confused about whether we were supposed to find the distinct time intervals using how the graph looked.
There wasn't anything confusing.
Something that was confusing was details regarding the A10 assignment, but at the end those issues were resolved.
Personally, I did not have any issues with the material in class today. There was not much new information and mostly group work.
We had a bit of trouble getting our graph of flow rate to be formatted correctly.","The turning in of assignment a10, but this was resolved by the end of class well enough

Finding the instantaneous flow rate is somewhat confusing on excel."
"The only confusing part about today's class was figuring out exactly why the Upper Reservoir collapsed, but after some research I figured it out.
I am not sure about if we should us the line of best fit for modeling the volume at the top of the dam. the linear model diverges from the data at the top where accuracy would be most important for calculating the safety. I was considering using a nonlinear model with the Excell regression tools.
I did not find anything confusing in today's class.
What we needed to turn in for the in class assignment.

"I was somewhat confused by some of the problems in assignment 10, but I worked through it with my group by the end of the class. For example, we were struggling to get the slope demonstrated in the slides.
I found the approach to modeling in A10 very confusing after class. After clearing it up with the professor and doing some experimenting on my own, I cleared it up.
The assignments are very vague. The individual assignments are pretty straightforward but the team ones are super confusing sometimes.
The overall approach to the reservoir's laminar approach was confusing, especially with the example of the graph and trendline. It was a bit vague.
I am still slightly confused on the purpose of finding the overall slope of the data. I know this can help find trends but am confused how this will help with scattered data. Overall, I get the process of it but found the purpose of it confusing.","Simple linear regression needed more details, especially as it relates to what the r squared value does.
Assignment 11 needed more explanation. Specifically, I struggled with the wording of particular questions. If the problems were more descriptive I would have understood the questions much easier.
Proper was to calculate the surface area to find volume
We could have gone over the laminar approach more because the regression line information seemed pretty easy to understand based on the module videos.
What will be covered in Exam 1"
"Today's class was little confusing and I didn't need any extra details.
The prototype section, specifically testing, is VERY confusing. My team is unsure how we are supposed to test our prototypes, especially if they are created using CAD software. Without purchasing materials, I'm unsure what could be used to create and test our solutions.
How detailed we need to be in our prototypes.
Finding ways to develop a prototype for our idea
I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype","We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to ourseparation.
How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one.
The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment.
I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
Thinking of prototypes while most of our ideas had to do with the road was confusing"
"The biotechnology was a little confusing and could be explained a little more in the context of a17.
I was confused about how to apply bio mimicry to this project.
Nothing. The assignment made sense and what the goals of different perspectives and ideas play into finding a solution
What parts of the technical brief that our group specifically needed to complete by next friday.
I did not find much confusing in class today. Most of the time was spent working in breakout rooms or on the quiz.","I thought that the emphasis on biomimicry was interesting, but I did not understand how it can be applied to our project. We are dealing with roads and traffic, so there is little I can see that the natural world can offer.
Something confusing in today's class was the instructions for the newA17 assignment, because we were unsure of what to work on.
I think we should have spent more time on how to create a functional decomposition chart
More information about the brainstorming process would be helpful to aid our team
Figuring out which parts of the overarching design project are due when was disorienting as it was not ever explained and only obscurely mentioned once on Brightspace."

"I was slightly confused about why the example problem in class today was a scatter plot, not a line graph. However, after speaking with my peers, the confusion was cleared up.
Some of the questions regarding numerical or categorical were sort of confusing; for example, if zip codes are categorical or numerical data. I searched it up online and understood it a bit more, but it would be nice if you could explain it in class.
These first two lectures were pretty solid. Most of the information needed for the assignment was to be learned out of the class, but for the most part it was a smooth beginning to the class.
Maybe some more specifics into the uses of excel for assignment 3 or general engineering, but in general the lecture was quite robust and the slides were very informative.
Occasionally, especially at the end, the presentation moved too quickly and became confusing.  I found myself having to re read large portions of it afterwards because it was too fast paced and difficult to follow.","Everything was pretty clear. But, I would like to review more on the different types of charts.
One thing that was a little confusing was the typing of certain symbols and formulas into Excel. For example, it was difficult for me to remember how to lock certain numbers as absolute values. Once I refreshed my memory I was able to get it because I did have experience with it while watching the pre-class videos, but it was a lot for me to remember. Also, I never figured out how to type the symbol for degrees with my keyboard into Excel.

"The at home quiz review is weird hornets broken up, I wish we just did one big review before the quiz rather than doing little bits here and there. it works better from what I've seen in all my other classes to just have a review session separate from all the other stuff and not having to learn stuff all the way to the quiz is also nicer as it gives students time to study. I also didn't like how we had an in class assignment and an activity, I prefer when we just had one as that gave more studio time to work on next week's assignment.
