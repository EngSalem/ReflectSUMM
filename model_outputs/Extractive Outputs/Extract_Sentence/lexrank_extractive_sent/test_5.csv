I was a bit confused by the different aspects of identifying which type of collision something was so I wish that was broken down quickly before starting the questions
I personally believe that the problem regarding the bullet and the can was a little bit confusing.","I thought that the rocket problem was a bit confusing because I wasn't sure if the problem was elastic or inelastic.
I personally believe that the problem regarding the bullet and the can was a little bit confusing.
The difference between completely inelastic and I inelastic collisions
some calculations, the bullet problem that was completely inelastic
The rocket problem"
153,"Today I was a little bit confused on the force body diagram draw during the power problem.
The power question, why was tension of the rope never factored in?
I feel as if the problems regarding the graphs and acceleration with respect to time could have been explained more.
The graph questions where we had to find velocity
Problems regarding potential energy. Of all things for spring and gravity.","Today I was a little bit confused on the force body diagram draw during the power problem.
Clarification on how we will be solving future problems without using integrals.

154,"I was confused about a lot of the light problems and examples
I found the tophat questions with all the angles and trig confusing. I understand it fundamentally but I think I need to work it out myself slower.
The light of reflection and refraction was a bit confusing and I think I just need more time and easier examples
Determining the direction at which light will be reflected or refracting is confusing. Like the first couple questions on top hat of determining which refraction indexes were bigger from just looking at the light rays.
Trigonometry review. Finding angles, similar triangles, etc.","The light of reflection and refraction was a bit confusing and I think I just need more time and easier examples
The idea behind the law of refraction was slightly confusing. Specifically the example with the fish and finding the radius of the circle through which light passes was confusing.

I was pretty confused on refraction, and seeing through the water in the ocean.
The refraction problem"
