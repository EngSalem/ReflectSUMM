I thought that it was interesting that momentum could be conserved. Elastic collisions are interesting because it applies both conservation of momentum and conservation of kinetic energy.
The collision demonstrations","The demonstrations with the objects sliding towards each other was interesting

I found it interesting that in every collision momentum is conserved even if kinetic energy is not.
The demonstrations on the air track
The collision demonstrations"
155,"I thought the in class demonstration with the polarizers was very interesting.
I really liked the light demonstration where you shined a light through a glass tube and then put it through water. It was cool seeing the light change.
I found the example with the laser and the refraction to be interesting.
I liked the last demonstration with the light filters. Probably my favorite demonstration of the year.
I liked the demonstration in class","The laser demonstrations with reflection and refraction were very fascinating! Excellent way to show the effect of reflection with light in multiple different indexes.
I found the laser pointers in the demos interesting because they are a good representation of light waves.
I found the fact that we could calculate the vision range of a fish interesting. I thought this example was engaging because of this. I also light the laser related examples because they were pretty. I also like the example of manipulating the light that could pass through the panes on the projector.
The demo showing how light gets through was very interesting.
I found most interesting was how water and air affect light."
