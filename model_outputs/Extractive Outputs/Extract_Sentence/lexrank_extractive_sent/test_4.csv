Nothing was confusing today during class.
I felt multiplexing was confusing
Something which I found to be a bit confusing was the concept of how unicast vs broadcast vs multicast changes when one is converted to the other. Since these types of communication primarily deal with one to either one, many or some, the idea of converting one type to another was a bit unclear. For example, if a private DM is posted publicly, would that now qualify as broadcasting?
The concept of circuit switched was slightly confusing and I feel like it lacked a proper definition during the lecture.","The concept of circuit switched was slightly confusing and I feel like it lacked a proper definition during the lecture.

It is still a bit difficult for me to know when to use each equation, but the explanations after each problem for this class were very useful for understanding each question"
154,"The problem with the triangle and 3 masses
I was confused on solving the net force for the masses on a triangle. The angle is what screwed me up. I made a simple vector mistake.
I still find finding the components of the force of gravity confusing even though it is like vector addition.
I was a bit confused on the direction of gravitational forces on objects.
I wish we could go more in-depth as to why the F = GMm/r^2 formula works. Compared to other formulas, I think this is one where the derivation can really help with the conceptual understanding.","I was confused on solving the net force for the masses on a triangle.

the first top hat question about 3 particle positions and the greatest force

155,"I thought it was interesting to see how different clicker questions gave different information that showed us when to use the different inductance equations.
The practice problem with integrations was helpful
I found the demonstration with the mutual induction to be very helpful in my understanding
What I found most interesting were the demonstrations especially the one where the bar was attracted to stay inside of the tube.
the demonstration of the two loops with the magnet that showed the graph on the screen","I found the demonstration at the beginning of class showing inductance with the rod in the middle of the solenoid to be interesting.
I found the demonstration with the mutual induction to be very helpful in my understanding
I found the demo where we got to see the graph representing induction up on the board. I thought it was especially interesting when the smaller inductor was used because we could see the fuzziness represented by interference from surrounding objects since the scale was so small.
Today I found it interesting to see the spark at the beginning of class. Doing demonstrations always makes class more interesting.
The demonstration of the rod being acted upon to pull it to the center interesting because there was no oscillation as I would expect. It just moved right into place."
