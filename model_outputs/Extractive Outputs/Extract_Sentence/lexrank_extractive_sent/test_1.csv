I was confused as to how we found the minima using the given equation.","I found the difference between dark and light equations for double and single slit experiments to be confusing because they are measure different values with the same stuff.
The single slit was confusing in the equation sense with the m representing dark and light differently than how the double slit did
Different combinations of slit width and slit separation. For example, what would it mean if the bright spots were more spread out, but the diffraction dark spots were in the same place for two slits?
The single slit intensity is little bit confused
The relationship between slit width and diffraction pattern."
144,"Phasors are little bit confused. Especially the relationships
I need help understanding phasers in general
What was confusing was deriving the equations and figuring out how the variables affected other variables.
I dont really understand how all the equations are going to come together
The sinusoidal graphs for resistors, capacitors and inductors","Today I was the most confused about the question with the three lines on the graph and figuring out which represented R, L, and C. I feel like I understand the circuits overall but might need to brush up on problems like that.
I was confused about how the equations with the Wd worked and how they are relevant.
It was confusing to keep track of the differences in graphs between inductors, capacitors, and resistors.
The idea of inductive reactance and capacitive reactance was confusing. I did not understand why these factors are necessary in the calculation of current and voltage.
What was confusing was deriving the equations and figuring out how the variables affected other variables."
145,"I enjoyed the many demonstrations that you had today. My favorites were the mini compasses and the audio machine.
I found the demos really cool, I think it was a really good way to see how the concepts work in real life.
I liked the real examples
I found the diamagnetic levitating frog most interesting because it was an example that applied to lecture content but was also very entertaining. I also like how they demos followed up explained content. The demos helped clarify the material and they were interesting to watch.
I found the lecture to be really interesting, it was more interesting to me than when we were taught about electricity","I found the demonstration with finding magnetic field around the poles of the magnet to be interesting.

I found it very interesting how putting a magnet up to a receiver will produce sound because of the electrons flipping around."
146,"phasers and it's application was a tad bit confusing, I did not understand how to obtain the right triangle.
Phasors in general are confusing to me.
I though that it was confusing to deal with the phase angle. Because it is already negative in the equation I would also think of the wrong sign for an answer about the sign of a phase angle.
If there is no limit to the voltage at any point in the circuit, how does this look in the height analogy for electric potential? What adds height (voltage) to the system?
How it is possible that the voltages across the components of an RLC circuit can exceed the emf","I found the part in which the instantaneous voltage had no limit short of breaking the circuit a bit confusing. What does this mean for the max emf of the circuit? Will it always be the same?
Phasors were okay, but still a bit confusing
Phasors in general are confusing to me.
I thought it was confusing to see when to use which equations to find current.
The idea of the maximum voltage being endless while the emf amplitude is 12 V was confusing to me. How exactly does that work?"
147,"I was confused about the first top hat question and why the induced magnetic field is opposite of the given magnetic field.
The integration tophat question
Lenz's law and how to determine direction of induced current and direction of magnetic field (induced or otherwise)
Is there a difference between induced current and regular current?
I think the use of right hand rule in Lenz law was a bit confusing, especially when distinguishing between original magnetic field and induced magnetic field.","I was confused about the first top hat question and why the induced magnetic field is opposite of the given magnetic field.
Still confused on determining the direction of magnetic field
I find the determining the direction of current and magnetic field confusing with the right hand rule because curling my fingers put the direction in different places.
the first problem on top hat where no one really got the answer, it was about magnetic flux and integrating
I thought determining when you need to integrate for a problem was confusing. When to integrate using certain equations and on some problems are not as obvious as the electric field chapter."
148,"I found all of the tophats more confusing, to be honest, especially the open ended one.
The dipole was a bit confusing especially how it rotates and how rotating will effect the energy
The process of dipoles flipping in an electric field to match their attractive charges
Nothing was confusing. One of the tophat questions about calculating the largest kinetic energy of a dipole rotating in a uniform electric field was a little tricky since I did not realize the final potential energy was a nonzero number.
nothing was confusing, everything was explained very well. I liked learning about how to solve problems with dipoles and point charges.","The last top hat question with electric field and potential energy
Nothing was confusing. One of the tophat questions about calculating the largest kinetic energy of a dipole rotating in a uniform electric field was a little tricky since I did not realize the final potential energy was a nonzero number.
Dipoles were pretty confusing. Potential energy was also weird and the max based on the angle was confusing.
I found the way potential energy works with charges to be confusing. Especially where it is 0 and where it's at its max. 
I was a little confused about the approximating small numbers but I think I understand now. The example in class with kinetic energy I was confused how you knew when max kinetic energy was if there was still potential energy"
149,"Today, I needed more clarification on the problem where all of the slides had the same value for work because I thought that slide C would have had the most work.
I felt I understood class fairly well today however I thought more of the fundamental/theoretical questions needed more explanation
I would have liked explanation for why certain formulas were applied. I understood how each was used in solutions, but still struggle with the thought process to get there. In other words, I understood why each thing was the correct answer but would like more explanation of how you would think of how to solve the problem.

150,"Learning about dot product being a scaler and that answers can still be negative was interesting because I was thinking that direction wouldn't matter.
i had never seen the formula for dot product by components before.
I found the problem regarding the dot multiplication was very intriguing. I was able to see how much one actually has to pay attention when solving a physics problem, and it is very easy to mess up if you are careless.

151,"I really enjoyed the Santa Claus demonstration of the stable equilibrium concept.
I liked the santa demonstration because it helped me picture static equilibrium and how it can be disturbed.
The example with Santa about static equilibrium.
I thought it was interesting that torque is analogous to force but it has the same units as work. It's also interesting that torque and work done by rotational kinetic energy have the same units too.
I thought it was interesting that you could move the axis to get rid of forces","I found our ability to calculate the angle a ladder would have to be at to be able to remain in equilibrium interesting. I also liked how this was augmented by the addition of a person (Santa) in the in-class demonstration. This and the door problem made me think about how torque can be applied to everyday life, which I think is interesting.
I thought that the santa demonstration was pretty interesting.
The Santa Claus demonstration and the torque top hat problems
I really enjoyed the example of santa claus climbing the ladder. This solidified my understanding of the problem with all of the forces acting on the ladder.

152,"Today, I was confused on the bike problem. Seeing it physically did help me visualize the situation. I think when I realized that slipping is just when an object is rotating but not actually moving transitionally really cleared things up.
The second bike problem where you pull from the bottom
I was confused on the relationship between the moment of inertia and speed/kinetic energy, but solving problems helped me to understand it better.
How all of the torque stuff works with rotating a tire.
I was confused what it meant when an object doesn't slip. Also, would rotational kinetic energy or friction affect the translational kinetic energy more?","I am still a bit confused about how in the second bicycle problem the rotoational acceleration goes left.

154,"Today I was a little bit confused conceptually on what K means in transverse waves. I understood how it works in the equations but the picture of with the different waves numbers confused me.
The partial derivative part of the wave equation was confusing and not brought up during class.
At first I thought that the wave equation was confusing, but after doing clicker questions it made sense how the variables worked.
I was confused by the picture of Marilyn Monroe. I understood that it represented a separation of wavelength values, but I had trouble determining which wavelengths are shorter and which are longer. I would have appreciated more detail on that example.

157,"the space ship relative motion problems
The spaceship in relation to other objects was a little confusing so it would be helpful if we did more problems like that in the future.
I was confused with the reference points at the start of the lecture. Mainly how the reference points of the spaceship and the person influenced the wrench
I found the problem with the acceleration vector confusing mainly because we have not done a problem like that before.
What was confusing is how weight and natural force are not an example of Newton's third law.","The spaceship in relation to other objects was a little confusing so it would be helpful if we did more problems like that in the future.
