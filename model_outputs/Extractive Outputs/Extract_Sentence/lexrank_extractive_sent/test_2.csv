superposition
The potential energy equal to 0 when the radius is infinity"
154,"Today I was confused on setting up energy problems with a spring. I needed some more clarification on the problem with the collision specially, but seeing it with the graph helped.
The concept of resonance made sense to me for the most part but I had trouble understanding it in terms of how energy transferred between the pendulums of the same length in the demonstration. I was also confused about the change in amplitude question. Can we ever directly calculate amplitude of is it just something that increases or decreases?
I was confused by resonance frequencies. I understand it conceptually but not how it works mathematically
I struggled with several of the tophat questions today. I feel as if I was confused with what equations to apply for each specific problem.
simple harmonic motion problem","Today I was confused on setting up energy problems with a spring. I needed some more clarification on the problem with the collision specially, but seeing it with the graph helped.
I thought that finding the frequency and amplitude of springs and pendulums in SHM were very confusing

The top hat amplitude calculation problem
The last practice problem for calculating the new amplitude of oscillation."
155,"The integrals and how they relate to the work and acceleration. And how acceleration relates to the force and integral.
The fact that integrals are able to give us an exact amount of work being done
the graph usage
I found it interesting to take the area of the curve with area rather than an integral because it helps me make connections to what we are actually solving for when we do an integral.
I enjoyed how we spent time with a break down of the exam, I was able to see and understand where I placed in comparison to the class.","I liked analyzing integrals/area under the graph in terms of work
The integrals and how they relate to the work and acceleration. And how acceleration relates to the force and integral.
The fact that integrals are able to give us an exact amount of work being done
The solving for work questions
You can use area under curve integrals to find max speed and velocity"
156,"The demonstrations
I found the demo of measuring the hair interesting because humor made the example very engaging. I also thought the spy satellite problem was interesting because it can be applied to a real life example and an example of this sort of application was given.
The demonstration with the hair
Measuring the hair was rather interesting, seeing it was a direct application of the material, and the same thing goes for the telescope calculations we did.
I found interesting was the diffraction pattern made to measure the width of hair","I found the demo of the hair to be interesting. In our real world, I realize how practical it is to use light diffraction to measure the width of objects.
i found the hair measuring and spy satellite applications to be immensely interesting
I found interesting was the diffraction pattern made to measure the width of hair
I found the experiment measuring the width of a hair the be very interesting.
I thought that the demonstration with the hair follicle was pretty interesting. It really got the class engaged."
