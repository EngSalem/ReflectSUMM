"i found the open ended top hat questions interesting because they required multiple concepts to be applied which made it all seem more connected and easier to understand conceptually
Electric fields in general
The electric field patterns were very interesting.
Visualizing electric fields! It was interesting to know how lines cannot cross and what it looks like for unlike charges
Using the charges and electric field to calculate torque","In today's class, I found it interesting that electric fields work how wind works. I learned that wind has many vectors as does electric fields.
The experiment when when could see the diopole, and the whole concept of polar molecules like water.
Torque and potential energy and how they apply to electric fields
How dipoles give molecules their unique properties
visualizing electric fields. Drawing abstract concepts makes them easier to understand."
"The practice problem where we were given the dipole dipole moment and had to find kinetic energy was quite challenging for me. If we could do another example like that, that would be great!
Water droplet problem is what I had the most trouble with.
The initial set up. Specifically the limits of integration and the variable of integration.
the integrations were confusing but i think i just need to focus more and review calc
I was confused about recognizing which variable you should take the the integral with respect to (depending on the problem)","The ring of charge section was the most confusing. Setting it up and finding E parallel and E perpendicular was the most confusing for me
While I understand the solving the integral process, I could use more clarity/examples of setting up integrals in different situations. Also, a deeper explanation of what exactly is happening to the electric field when influenced by an extended charge.
I felt the lecture was going too fast and felt that we should go over details more rather than flying through each tophat question.
I am really having trouble setting up integrals for the electric field. I don't understand how to set it up given the linear density and the charge.
The initial set up. Specifically the limits of integration and the variable of integration."
"I thought the ammeter and voltmeter were the most interesting part, especially after the concept quiz and seeing how the voltmeter was the emf
i thought that the applications of grounding and how that could simplify complicated circuits was interesting
Learning the paths circuits take and what way the current flows I found to be very interesting. It's cool to see how current flows in real wires and in real life.
Voltmeters and ammeters are really interesting in that I think it's cool that we can actually measure these concepts (voltage and current) pretty easily
i liked that no matter which path you took to find current in a circuit, you'll get the same value.","The amount of info we can determine from a simple circuit with proper analysis is very cool.
I thought grounding was interesting. I never understood what grounding meant before.
I found the ammeters and voltmeters interesting because they can both be used in the same circuit but for different reasons.
i liked that no matter which path you took to find current in a circuit, you'll get the same value.
I found it interesting using the loop rule to solve the last problem because it made the problem more simple than I initially thought."
"I'm a bit confused by how the equations relate together so more explanation and examples would be great.
why is it that you can use the one eqn(.5cv^2) for ANY shape when it was mentioned that shape is the factor that changes the C variable.
The difference between the two variables that use U was very confusing. How energy relates to capacitance just wasn't clear to me.
What this truly is, I do not understand what we are solving, and the use of what the value K is.
In video 2, why did U and V start at the same place?","one thing that was confusing for me was the actual calculations regarding the topic. I was a bit confused on that part of the concept quiz.
The difference between the two variables that use U was very confusing. How energy relates to capacitance just wasn't clear to me.
Calculating cylindrical capacitors
In video 2, why did U and V start at the same place?
In today's class I found it confusing how the units work between charge and capacitance and electric potential. I found it confusing what a farad is."
"I was a little confused about the last example in lecture for finding the voltage in each resistor because I wasn't sure how the amps split in the circuit
the relationship between the internal voltage of a battery vs. the external voltage.
I found resistors in series fairly confusing just because I find myself getting tripped up with how to add voltage in the series.
For the first time ever in this class I feel like I actually understand all the cuvids for this section.
I think I actually understood this one well. The only thing I truly struggled was the second part with the battery, the E and the delta V","It wasn't confusing, but I think going over Ohm's law and when you can and can't use it would be helpful
I found resistors in series fairly confusing just because I find myself getting tripped up with how to add voltage in the series.
I thought the examples at the end of the cuvids for the first set were a little confusing, I wasn't sure how the equations were derived
the relationship between the internal voltage of a battery vs. the external voltage.
Trying to figure out if things are in series or parallel"
"honestly everything was pretty clear today! maybe the lightning part could have been a little more clear, but if you were really paying attention it made sense!
The difference in using the formula c1*c2/c1+c2 vs using the equation for parallel capacitance or series capacitance confuses me a bit on the concept quiz.
Series capacitors and resistance
I was confused about how you know when capacitors are in parallel with each other.
What the units represented in the context of each other.","I'm a little confused on how charge is distributed on capacitors in series vs capacitors in parallel.
I thought that it was a little confusing why in the 1st example you performed you added the non matching capacitance (C3) with C2 and plugged that into the expression. and on our sapling concept quiz, we instead used expression (C1*C2)/(C1+C2)+ C3. why were we allowed to do that for that problem and not this one? genuinely confused.
I was confused about how you know when capacitors are in parallel with each other.
The only thing I felt was kind of confusing was charge density. In lecture, you said that current density and the electric field went in opposite directions and I found that slightly perplexing.
The current density was the most confusing for me because I was just a bit confused on how to set up the integral."
"I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
I think the most interesting part was the use of break out rooms to allow the students to collaborate on a problem
The thing that I found most interesting was the way he explained how to get the answer and how he showed multiple ways of getting to the answer.
I found the hockey question interesting because it was challenging but after working in groups we were able to figure it out
I liked getting to use top hat during class and getting put into the break out rooms. I think that it made class more interesting and helped to keep me engaged in what was going on.","I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy tofollow. 
I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged inpractice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I enjoyed using Top Hat because it kept me active during the lesson."
"I'm a bit confused on the most efficient way to solve for a variable
I was confused about the relation of the force when the rope was pulled down on the pulley. It was also unclear where the equations we used in the problems derived from.
Today, I think harder examples could have been taught because the simple ones were a great introduction to the topic, but they were also covered in the topic. The concepts were easy to understand and the lesson was taught well but I think that the questions could have been more conceptual or harder to accomplish.
doubling the force of tension
The top hat question about the man holding himself up and how there would be two forces of tension","The problem that involved the man pulling himself up on a pulley was difficult to understand.  If the man is pulling down with the same forceas the tension, shouldn't that cancel out one of the tensions ?
The top hat problem with the 3 blocks. We covered this towards the end, and as we were crunched for time, I thought the problem wasn't discussed as much as I would've liked. 
In today's lecture, I was bit confused by the free body diagram of friction. How would friction change if the normal force was at an angle to the horizontal? 
The fact of there being two tensions confused me for one of the first questions we did. I didn't quite get the 2T, but I think I understand it now after it was explained. 
 Force magnitudes when there are multiple masses such as a person pushing on three rocks. It's just sometimes confusing on which masses to add or the exact forces acting on the masses."
"I think it was really clear. However, I would have liked if the TA's came to the breakout rooms so that we can all discuss about the career WDM. I think they know valuable information.
I was very confused by what was supposed to go onto criteria and what was supposed to go into metrics. The difference between the two was not clear.
The whole setup behind a weighted matrix is still confusing to me, and i do not see a significant benefit behind it yet
Nothing! It all made sense!
Nothing was confusing, there was a good explanation of weighted decision matrixes.","The due date of assignment 18 was confusing 
I was a little confused about what to put as the metrics in the weighted decision matrix at first. 
Part of the decision matrix discussion was a little confusing on all of the different aspects that were needed in parts one, two, and three. 
I was a little confused on how to choose my criteria for the in class activity.
 I wasn't completely sure about what to do for the in class activity because the template had a lot of slots to fill out but we only had todo some of it, but it wasn't completely clear about what parts we were supposed to do."
"I thought the game where you guessed the r-value most interesting.
Knowing how to use and model equations with the laminar approach was helpful with understanding our data.
I enjoyed learning how to make the linear regression on Mac books. I also appreciated the help I got from the PTs.
Group discussion! I have finished a lot of progress during the breakout room for the team project.
I found it interesting how you can simply just make a scatter plot on excel out of your data and it will create an equation for the line of best fit for you.","The linear regression was fun to learn about.
Learning about the values of r and how they relate to the accuracy of a trend line
Working with my group on both the in class assignment and the A10 assignment.
I enjoyed talking about regression lines correlations and playing the correlation game.
I found it interesting that it is so easy to do complex, helpful calculations in Excel."
"I understood everything in class today and enjoyed the time you gave us with our teams. The only thing i would say could be improved was there was some confusion over where the files were for the in class quiz 1.
I believe in today's lecture they probably could've been a better instruction on the fact that only one person had to submit the skittles data. Therefore we would be about to do all of our assignment right away.
I was confused on what what our in class participation was for 3b. I wasn't sure if we needed to submit anything or not.
The deadlines for all the assignments were confusing, and the probability was a little confusing at first
I didn't quite fully grasp what z tables were and how do we figure out what values to use for funding the numbers","The directions for the skittles activity in class were sort of confusing at first, but our team figured out what needed to be done
Assignment 08 was confusing because the directions were not clear. I had my hand raised in the breakout room and no one came.
I didn't quite fully grasp what z tables were and how do we figure out what values to use for funding the numbers
The formulas that we went over today are somewhat confusing to me. Other than that I thought class was very good!
I am still confused about how to create and use histograms and the shortcuts for using excel. The normal distribution questions are also confusing."
"The assignment we are working on right now is confusing because we dont know how many idea generation techniques we have to use
It was confusing what part V was supposed to resemble and what iteration #1 meant. It was confusing that there was no explanation for this assignment.
Some of the specific things about A17 like how many ideas we need and the stuff Jeff mentioned at the end being brought up for the first time.
The most confusing part of today was figuring out where and who we would be getting feedback from.  Since we didn't have feedback yet we were confused what we should use for part 5.
nothing","How much of The iteration we are supposed to do for A17
Hearing about the first iteration feedback left us without a real answer.
It is confusing on what we are supposed to build for our prototypes.
I was confused on which assignment we were supposed to be doing because online it said 5,6 but it was fixed.
I was confused at what parts of the project we actually need to complete."
"I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
I was confused on when we start A11 because it said we started it today in class however I didn't see A11 in 4A Assignments started in class and on the last slide about due dates it said A11 is due at the beginning of 5B
More feedback on our submitted work.
I would have liked a few more details on some of the more open-ended/newer concepts and questions that we will need to figure out.","My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn't know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
More feedback on our submitted work.
I did not understand the APA style of notation. In this class, I have gotten points taken off for having the assignment in APA. I cannot find a resource to how to make these references correctly.
 The date which assignment A10 is due was the most confusing part about the lecture today.
How to perform some of the calculations on the assignment given."
"There wasn't much to be interested in or uninterested in, since most of the class was working on the project. I suppose seeing the equations relating to investments was moderately enticing.
I found the uses and calculations for capital costs and payback periods in applicable scenarios to be interesting in today's class.
I liked working with our group for a long amount of time!
Learning about how long a captial investment will payoff was interesting , because we might use it later on.

 I found that the CAD design of our final solution was interesting as it was cool to see a 3d model of it."
"There was very little info on WHAT the laminar approach was. I wish that the instructors gave us more clear info about what the task at hand required. It took my group a long time to figure out what was going on.
at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sst and sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better
I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.
Everything is clear for me, and the explanation about correlation is understandable.
Nothing was really confusing except how we were put in breakout rooms for a bit and then taken out of them for an announcement that could have just be typed in chat so we didn't have to leave breakout rooms. It would have let us keep our train of thought","I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation. I could relatively understand it but I could not explain what it is used for. Hopefully some confusions could be cleared next class.
The most confusing thing was calculating the regression constant value.
The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. 
at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sstand sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better"
"I found how we are all taking separate data and then combining it to create one bigger data set pretty interesting!
I found the process of using and finding z scores on the normal distribution curve to be interesting.
Z scores are interesting

Nothing was confusing in this class.
It was confusing that we had to know what engineering fields were needed to solve this problem when we have no finished the career exploration activity.
I found that calculating the flowrate over distinct time intervals was confusing as when I originally calculated it I thought that it was in acreft/min but it was actually in acreft/day which changed the data a lot.
I thought we would review more for the exam, but we barely went over any information.","I was confused by the instructions meant by what disciplines ofengineering would have helped improve the disaster in the future. I didnot know what the profesor was referring to.

 all of the different resources for trustworthy information was interesting.
I'm very interested in formulating the volume calculation for the reservoir by using the Laminar Approach.
I really enjoyed the team discussion periods of the class and found the instructions very helpful."
"I found the engineering failures for the Taum Sauk reservoir to be an insightful example of how engineering projects can go badly based on negligence and lack of proper ethics by engineers involved in orchestrating it.
The reservoir was super flawed and had a ton of issues with oversight and basic land surveying.
i thought constructures experts make can also be fallen
I liked that I was able to spend more time with my group mates so that i could work on A12.
I found it really interesting how most disasters in engineering are entirely presentable.","I found it interesting that such little flaws in engineering design orcommunication can lead to such drastic and catastrophic failures ofmechanisms and projects.

I thought that I might need alittle help with setting up the mathematic models
To get the best result, I was confused of which value I should use.","Creating models was definitely confusing and could use more explanations in the future. I felt like I need additional guidance finding the best approach when trying to create a model and how to improve models to make it the best possible.
The thing that was confusing today was trying to figure out a mathematical model that fit the slope change of the reservoir. It was confusing because it is difficult to picture a function that would map all of this information.
I would've appreciated if we went over the laminar approach in more depth. It was unclear what our excel file should look like.

More details on the quiz could have been beneficial.
Nothing was confusing today, we had a lot of good work time during class","Simple linear regression needed more details, especially as it relates to what the r squared value does.
Assignment 11 needed more explanation. Specifically, I struggled with the wording of particular questions. If the problems were more descriptive I would have understood the questions much easier.
Proper was to calculate the surface area to find volume
We could have gone over the laminar approach more because the regression line information seemed pretty easy to understand based on the module videos.
What will be covered in Exam 1"
"I found that calculating volume of complex shapes can be do e using the laminar method and a depth of 1 ft.
I really like this project idea. I've modeled a coal-fired generator as a rankine cycle before in my thermodynamics class, and this project seems to be really similar.
I really enjoy the progression to more group time
The thing I found most important in today's class is that the mathematical model doesn't have to be specific to one answer and is based on the preference of the person making it. However, such preferences can alter the accuracy of the calculations made based on the model.

I was confused on the metrics section.
nothing
The executive summary part of A16","I found the difference between problem scoping and what we have been doing in each of the previous assignments confusing because the difference isn't really clear to me. As I read deeper into the assignment I hope this will be cleared up.
Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day. 
 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial. 
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was do you account for criteria that isn't stated by the client in the problem statement or just in the table for criteria and constraints?
 I would've appreciated more time spent on how we are expected to empathize with different users. For online students like me it is unclear how we are expected to empathize with many different users when we aren't on campus and also when we don't know a large amount of people who live on or around campus."
"I liked the addition of probability, the normal curve and z scores to our class. I feel that is going to be helpful in the future.
Skittle activity was fun to do.
I really liked the breakout rooms because it felt like my group accomplished a lot and asked questions when needed. I also felt like the Z score information was helpful because it cleared up some confusion from the “complete before class” module.
z-scores can help to find probability of certain events.
The use of z-scores","Learning how to use the z score and putting it in practice 
 It was interesting how we can use the bell curve graphs to talk about probability.

 It was interesting to learn more about histograms and how they can be used
 I enjoyed working with my group to complete the assignments because we got to work together and finish the work as a group"
"It was a little bit confusing figuring out how to edit the overflow data. Also, this is part of the Modules not the class but I don't understand why the center of a bin is not just the middle number of that bins range (in the module 31 was not the answer for the range 30-32).
How to make histograms was confusing. Jeff told our group in the breakout room that we have to base the histogram off of bin width, not bin number. This wasn't clear in the modules or lecture.
Determining the bin's upper limit and underflow
In today's class, it was unclear about whether the data in the in class activity was numerical or categorical or ordinal and nominal.
I thought that the choosing which graph to use part of class was confusing today. I am still confused about nominal vs ordinal and numerical vs categorical.","The only part of today's class was being able to identify the type of data.
I am still a little bit unclear on how to work some of the aspects on excel including changing the axis value on a Mac.
How to know what data representation method to chose given data.
For A07, I am confused on how we customize the bin widths AND number of bins. 
I feel like the guidance on how we are supposed to complete and do assignments is minimal, and I feel like we the students don't have the ability to reach out for help from the instructor or a TA when we are in our small groups."

no today is much more clear than the former","Three Sum example was very confusing, so it would be nice to go over it again. Also just more practice problems with determining the runtime of functions. And lastly just reiterating the formal definitions of the Big O family
The triple loops example and finding the runtime I got really lost in how we determine how to segment the loops into pieces and also how to calculate each individual output. Also why O(n) is the same as O(n+1) ie why the +1 is dropped from the calculation.
I found it hard to follow some of the math done to analyze code examples, as well as towards the beginning with the formal definitions of the big o family.

The question using the equation to find delta v was pretty interesting and it gave me a short look at a part of what engineering students do in AAE.
I found that changing the number to text format was interesting because the format impacts the graphs and such as well.

Using polyfit was a little challenging to me. I had to have a group member explain it to me and change some things because I originally tried to do the problem without it.
I was not confused about anything. I understand how to obtain the SSE and SST values in order to get and R^2
polyfit lines","Todays class was pretty straightforward. It was taking what we knew about sse, sst, and r squared values and applied it to matlab. However, I was a little confused the polyfit and polyval functions. I used them correctly thanks to the help of my teammate, but other than the minimal information given in the pre class video, I was pretty lost.
There was not a lot of new information this class, but I guess one of the more confusing things was the matlab syntax with the new graphing and best fit functions
I thought it was slightly confusing on A12 trying to figure out what data we should use for problem 2 on carbon dioxide.
In todays lecture I was confused about the goodness of fit on how to calculate the SSE as I know the formula however I am not sure what f(xi) really means and what is f(xi) how do you calculate it from the data or just given a graph with no line of best fit or r^2.
I would have liked more details about the upcoming concept quiz and A12, especially since we only have one more class before spring break."

I found the ifelse loops the most entertaining and very useful for any future projects I undertake involving decision making.","I found the ifelse loops the most entertaining and very useful for any future projects I undertake involving decision making.

I found the logical operators the most interesting because they have so many applications

i thought it was interesting how you can use the script to find out text displays for different values."
"I had some confusion on the order of operations in Matlab before class, so it would have been nice to go into more detail regarding that.
I was confused on the default layout of matlab. My matlab has separated my script and my command tabs to separate pages and I am confused how to put it back.
The start of the second part of A06 is very confusing because it is completely new.
What was confusing in class today was the logical operator xor and felt like it could used some more detail since and and or operators are more common throughout programming.
The information regarding logical operators and using them in combination with the find commanded was not clear.","I think I need more practice with making a truth table. I was also struggling to predict the outcomes of logical operators.
I found the third part of the in class activity as to what the variables represented.
I was confused on the default layout of matlab. My matlab has separated my script and my command tabs to separate pages and I am confused how to put it back.
I was confused for the components that I need to put for my plots for asssignment 06. I'm was not 100% sure about if I'm following the instructions correctly or not.
The difference between sgtitle and title for making titles for graphs. It can be confusing because some of the commands used are not applicable for both."
"assignment A06
How to display figures were confusing, specifically how you were to separate the figures so it didn't just display all 3 figures from A06 together on the same graph. The subplot counting was weird how it was the opposite of linear indexing but it was covered well so that worked out in the end.
It was confusing partly because I was on zoom so flipping back and forth between my brightpsace and zoom and Matlab is tricky.
One thing that I found to be confusing was how to plot multiple datasets in one plot, as I forgot about the hold on and hold off commands.

The idea of creating multiple figures in one plot was pretty confusing to me. I was also confused about the components that I need to put in my plots.

I think that the array indexing is still confusing. I do not understand how to select values from only a row or a column
For our 3A activity, I had difficulty understanding the graph. Whether the Y axis represented the VOC emissions from the production of the Subarus or from the exhaust from the actual cars."
