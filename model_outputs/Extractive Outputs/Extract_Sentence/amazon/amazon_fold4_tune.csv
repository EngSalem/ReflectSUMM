"Circuit analysis
The circuits in general are interesting.
Power and how it relates to resistors
The fact that batteries actually have more volts than displayed as it loses it over time is interesting.
electromotive force was really interesting","All of the different ways to use Ohm's Law by rearranging the equation
I thought it was nice at how easy calculating resistance was after proving with algebra that the resistors in series can just be additively calculated
I found it interesting how we are drawing circuits out. Also I found it interesting how we are starting to calculate how circuits work.
Power and how it relates to resistors
Applying physics concepts to real life applications"
"Examining electricity in motion is reaply interesting after looking at it static for so long
How the current ""flows""through a conductor
I thought the example about the lightning bolt hitting the water was really cool. I also thought that the difference the current flows through saltwater and freshwater was interesting, even though it wasn't supposed to be part of our lesson.
I thought it was interesting creating the series scenarios. It's sort of engaging cresting your own picture of a circuit.
Drift velocity and current resistance","I found it interesting how we are now drawing our circuits in series and parallel. Itvs interesting to see how electricity works in the real world.
How the current ""flows""through a conductor
Calculating capacitance in circuits
We can calculate the numeric value of complicated electrical concepts in physics.
I thought the example about the lightning bolt hitting the water was really cool. I also thought that the difference the current flows through saltwater and freshwater was interesting, even though it wasn't supposed to be part of our lesson."
"I liked learning about the values of the different kinds of materials like air and paper, etc.
Dielectric strength of air explaining how much electric field is needed for lightning to strike
The dielectric strength of a vacuum blew my mind.
I thought that the dielectrics were very cool just because it seems like it is going beyond just math. The concept of a circuit with a battery was also interesting.
I found it interesting that dielectrics can change capacitance.","Dielectrics were interesting. Especially the physics of weaker dielectrics creating a dipole moment within the atoms despite it obviously having less forces to work with.
Parallel plate capacitors seemed to make the most sense
I liked learning about the values of the different kinds of materials like air and paper, etc.
Applying learned concepts to a more real world situation and seeing how it works/functions
I found it interesting how we are now drawing circuits with batteries capacitors and switches and relating it to the equations we used in class."
"The way the magnitude is multiplied by two or is zero based off of arrows in problems.
I was confused how to calculate the direction of the area vector.
Maybe more into detail reg the choosing of Gaussian surface?
The part that confused me the most was when we were looking at a conductor and an insulator and trying to figure out the electric field value of each shell.
This lesson was so much clearer to understand than my high school lesson on flux. It was neat how you tied together both flux and gauss's law seamlessly. I had a really tough time last year trying to understand gauss's law.","In the example problem, you would pull numbers and I was not sure where the numbers would be from. Could you be more clear on where these numbers would be coming from in class?
Choosing a Gaussian surface. I'm still not sure what types/orientations of surfaces produce symmetry that allow certain components to cancel out.
I found the whole concept of flux very unclear. I didn't really grasp it on the fundamental level and the mathematical interpretation of the concept doesn't make sense to me.
I was confused how to calculate the direction of the area vector.
The part that confused me the most was when we were looking at a conductor and an insulator and trying to figure out the electric field value of each shell."
"I liked the electric flux portion of the lecture this week. I liked reading the diagrams and solving for the charge in the example with the box.
I found GaussIan surfaces pretty interesting since you can draw a shape and then make solving Gauss' law easier to solve.
I find it interesting that such a complex value like flux can be measured by a dot product and not a more complicated calculus method.
I found out that Gauss's law is just flux over an imaginary shape, like a potato. I think this helped clear up much of my confusion.
How we can use field lines to determine the charge of a surface","I really like the flux topic. The concept questions about these were something that I found relatively easy to answer after watching the lecture videos in advance.
I found Faraday cages cancelling out external electric fields very interesting. It was also neat how the internal cap of a cylinder imbedded in a conductor has no flux, but the external end does.
I found Gauss's Law interesting based on the fact that it can simplify a very difficult problem
I thought it was interesting how we can prove the equation for E is correct by doing some math.
I found it interesting that an electric field can flow through a surface. I also found it interesting that you can calculate the charge enclosed in an area"
"Much was very thorough and clear. I had some issues understanding the diagrams at first, not sure why. Seems a few others were confused with how to interpret the diagram as well. Nevertheless, it was a good self problem solving period. and when the prof explained, it was clear and well executed. I understood more being confused and then being enlightened and shown how the diagram was supposed to represent the particles and their charges. furthermore, after the first diagram it seemed like I felt I was absorbing s a lotmore from the concepts you were trying to get through to us.
n/a
I really didn't understand the second top hat question with the two particles that were repelling eachother and then a third particle touches both of them respectively. I know how the first particle touches the third particle so it's q value and the first particles q value are halved. I also know how the second particle touches the third particle and doing (1/2+1)/2 is 3/4 for both particles. I just didn't know where to go from there to solve for F' or F because I didn't know what it defined as F' and F. You probably mentioned it though and it just went too quickly for me.
Overall, today's class was really good! I thought that each tophat question was well explained. I was a little confused with some of the math steps you took in simplifying, because you never showed any conversions, but the whole concept was clear.
In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works.","In today's class the Shell theorem was very confusing to me. I did not understand how it works.
What I found unclear was the lightbulb lighting up due to the work done by the professor. It was stated that the work done caused the lightbulb to light up and the electrons moving into the lightbulb.
I thought that everything was very clear, however I felt that some of the time given for the TopHat questions was insufficient. There were multiple times where I scrambled to put in an answer that ended up being wrong because I was one or two steps away from the right answer but didn't have time to finish the problem.
The idea of grounding was unclear to me. I did not understand how charge can be left over in a particle after it has been grounded.
I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value."
"Top hot conceptual questions
The tension problems, especially the part with all the salami.
The tug of rope scenario. This was interesting because the tension between the two pullers depends on both not just the stronger one.
In today's video, I found the tension in the ham and tug-o-war the most interesting. It was cool to find out that the tension is the same for the hams
How the wrench in the spaceship keeps moving in the same direction as long as nothing acts upon it. All the problems that went along with the wrench","I found most of the top hat questions interesting and I feel like they help solidify the concepts that we are going over 
 I found the tension problems to be the most interesting because I was able to understand them more after the lecture. 
 I found inertial reference frames most interesting in this lecture and how they compare to non inertial reference frames.
free body diagrams make sense to me because it is easy to draw the lines and i am familiar with them already
I found Newton's first law very interesting. Being able to apply real life experiences such as car travel to physics is fun."
"The equation was confusing a little bit.
I think that today's class was well explained and very clear. I think my group is struggling due to a group member missing class this week.
Nothing was confusing in today's class.
Everything was clear.
Nothing! I feel like you explained everything very well!","Some of the requirements on the A13 pdf were a little confusingattimes. I was confused on what information I needed and where to putit. ATA was very helpful in explaining what I needed to do.
I do not know how to compute the three year pay back period for Assignment 13.
The most confusing part was calculating coal co2 emissions.
The equation presented was confusing and could have been explained a little more 
 Capital investment equation when do we know when to leave out certain numbers"
"Seeing which types of plots were used for different sets of data was interesting.
I liked the fact that we were given time to work during the class. Usually classes are really fast, and this slows it down and allows better understanding ( for me)
In class I most enjoyed going out into break out rooms because I was able to learn from my peers and collaborate on the assignments given to us
Identifying the correct chart to use based on data sets
The formatting of the graphs in excel was interesting. I learned a lot about how to use the program.","The most interesting thing in todays class was learning more about what charts are the most appropriate during certain situations.
The opportunity to learn about other engineering careers was interesting 
Getting to know my engineering team on a better basis was definitely the most interesting part of class. Spending more time in breakout rooms would be helpful.
 I felt like I really learned a lot in class today, especially what makes a good client statement.
 I found interesting/important how the professor explained things on bright space and upcoming due dates."
"Overall today's class was very smooth and helpful. I did not think anything was confusing or needed more details. The instructions were very straightforward.
I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.
Overall I found everything fine, the only thing confusing was the coursemirror app setup but that is now resolved.
The organization of the homework and class schedule throughout the semester was unclear and Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments. If more details could be given about using Brightspace, where things will be, and it would be easier to proceed smoothly throughout the class.
The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.","I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time.
The question about drawing an engineer in ten years. It was a very vague question that gave little direction 
The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR
Brightspace is a little hard to navigate when searching for due dates and assignments"
"The design project seems interesting, and I am excited to come up with a solution with my team.
I found all the things you had to consider during the design process interesting
Have a deeper understanding about problem statement and problem scoping
I was excited to get started learning about different mobility solutions.
I liked the funny comic that was shown and it gave a good representation.","I found the time being able to work on the Assignment with my group to be the most helpful and interesting.
 I like the design process a lot more than tables and calculation.
I really enjoyed the project prompt that we were given because I thought there are some really interesting ways to solve the problem
I found the problem scoping part to be most interesting as I understand now how useful it is to engineering.
I think the fact that we are coming up with a solution that could improve campus is interesting because of how relevant it is to us as students."
"I thought today's class was pretty straightforward and nothing was too confusing
Why we use line plots over scatter plots
I am still slightly confused on the career exploration assignment and if we are required to submit anything or simply attend the four events.
I thought that today's class went well, the breakout rooms were given plenty of time, and initially the EYM sessions vs major videos was confusing, but this was eventually answered! Thanks!
Nothing was confusing, I fully understood the graphs in the slideshow as well as the excel graphing methods","The slides on the career exploration was a little confusing
Exactly where assignments need to be submitted was a little confusing, as well as the naming scheme for certain assignments.
 The only thing that maybe could use more clarification is how andwherewe will be signing up for the engineering discipline classes
Why we use line plots over scatter plots
It's a little confusing navigating Brightspace to find everything."
"I really liked the part of class where we were able to see what our carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions were.
I found the class activity the most interesting. This was because it involved our own lives with our own cars.
I just enjoyed working on the solar project. My group had some problems to work out relating to the assignment, and those were enjoyable to solve.
I found how engineers have to take ethics into consideration with things like climate change interesting. I also found the different slides showing glaciers and ice melting very interesting. The contrast was something I was not expecting in the pictures shown during class.
Solar panel specs","I thought that the most interesting thing in today's class was figuring out your carbon footprint. I did not know it before today and so thought it was nice to learn about.
The most interesting part of class was working through assignment 13 with my group.
 I found it very interesting that we got to find the amount of CO2 that our cars emit, it's nice to know what impact we have on theenvironment 
 I enjoyed the long amounts of time we had to work as a team on the assignment
I found the many ways to view trade-offs and the different ethical points that need to be considered to be the most interesting part of today's class."
"Nothing is confusing today
Nothing. I could use more clarification on the forecast of the project.
problem scoping
Everything was explained well. My group faced a bit of confusion regarding what parts of the document A16 contained, but that was cleared up once Jeff visited our breakout room.
The class wasn't confusing today. The only part of the class that I found somewhat confusing was the In-Class Assignment. The directions were relatively straightforward but slightly confusing based off how they were conveyed.","The part of A16 where we are tasked to come up with questionsandresponses is confusing because of the little amount of time we havetogain actual answers. 
 It was confusing on how to find the full project document because it wasn't in the same place as it was for other people.
what is needed for the first part of the assignment was inconsistent 
I was confused about the document and the specific tasks we needed to complete by next class
I was confused about the quiz over Module 32 because I checked beforeclass and the quiz was not available until class started so I missedthis assignment."
"It was confusing that we calculated the height of a pipeline since we just learned full on data analysis.
I was confused about how to go about finding the two mathematical models for the taum Sauk tank because i didn't know where to find the lengths
Todays class should have noted that we can make up the shape of the reservoir container
I found the in class assignment confusing. I did not know if you needed to use the formula or not.
When I was working on coming up with the two alternative mathematical methods, I was a little uncertain on what is expected from these models.","This class wasnt very confusing, but the part where we went overformulas for finding perimiter of the shapes was somewhat confusing.
It was confusing that we calculated the height of a pipeline since we just learned full on data analysis.
The in class assignment was confusing in what the task was and how to complete it.
 I was confused about what kinds of models are necessary for assignment 10.
I'm confused on the laminar approach and how to calculate the volume"
"I was a bit confused on due dates and the general premise of assignment A10. I wish we would have spent more time going over what was expected in assignment A10. My internet connection was also unstable so that may have something to do with how well I understood the lecture.
How to calculate power from volume in power resovoirs
I was confused on when we start A11 because it said we started it today in class however I didn't see A11 in 4A Assignments started in class and on the last slide about due dates it said A11 is due at the beginning of 5B
More feedback on our submitted work.
I would have liked a few more details on some of the more open-ended/newer concepts and questions that we will need to figure out.","The due date of Assignment 10 and the information needed to complete it.
I think that APA citing resources could have been covered more to get a better understanding of how to cite APA and where to have sources cited.
How much detail is needed on these peer evaluations??
 Today's class was pretty clear. The discussion about how reservoirs work could have been clearer to help us better understand the process of how the energy is harvested.
the new project"
"A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful.
More in depth about how to make more complicated histograms
Excel is still confusing to use.
i didn't understand that the histograms didn't need the date so i spent the whole break out room confused. I also think the breakout rooms should've been longer.
There was nothing confusing in the class today for me. I thought everything was explained very well.","A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful.
The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped.
I wish we saw the slide you were talking about that had al the due dates so we didn't have to find it later
The underflow and overflow was confusing for the bins.
The instructions for the in class assignment wasn't posted in the chat until near the end of the breakout room. This made the assignment difficult to complete."
"The way to do the problem in excel
Nothing was confusing today! I understood the class activity very well and our team also clarified any confusion we had about assignment 13 with each other.
Specifics of the in class activity.
My group had confusion on our assignment 12 feedback, but we got our questions answered.
I would like it if the professor let us know when our grades were put in so we could check them sooner.","Just for me personally, I had a hard time calculating thecapitalinvestment, but when you showed the slide on how to do it, ithelpedclarify some of my confusion
Something that was confusing in today's class was what apaybackperiodmeant. I wasn't sure if it was and actually length of time,oranamount of money per time. But I figured it out. 
I think the environmental analysis will prove to be confusing for class 8A.
 The equation was mostly explained but the excel portion was a little confusing
 The energy division for the assignment needs better clarification because we need specific values for the usage."
"I liked the addition of probability, the normal curve and z scores to our class. I feel that is going to be helpful in the future.
Skittle activity was fun to do.
I really liked the breakout rooms because it felt like my group accomplished a lot and asked questions when needed. I also felt like the Z score information was helpful because it cleared up some confusion from the “complete before class” module.
z-scores can help to find probability of certain events.
The use of z-scores","Learning how to use the z score and putting it in practice 
 It was interesting how we can use the bell curve graphs to talk about probability. 
I found the skittles to be a fun and interesting example of how to use our skills to actually do something.
 It was interesting to learn more about histograms and how they can be used
 I enjoyed working with my group to complete the assignments because we got to work together and finish the work as a group"
"I did not know that one quiz would be dropped at the end of the semester
I found it really interesting that you can use slope to calculate the rate at which water is entering and exiting the upper reservoir. It's cool that this is a real world application of mathematics.
I liked working through the problem and finding out I had a big portion of the work done already
I really think this project is one of the most interesting projects I've worked on in a very long time. I think understanding the data and forming our own equations is very interesting
Working with my group on the Assignment 12","I liked how we had enough class time to really get into A12 and divide out the work.

I thought the video about the beetle research was very interesting. It was cool to see some research happening on campus.
I enjoyed learning about biomimicry.
The methods for generating ideas are very interesting because they are going to be useful throughout engineering.
I enjoyed the class, however, most of the time was spent working in breakout rooms or on the quiz.

"Nothing
One thing that was confusing about today's class was do you account for criteria that isn't stated by the client in the problem statement or just in the table for criteria and constraints?
I was confused on the metrics section.
nothing
The executive summary part of A16","I found the difference between problem scoping and what we have been doing in each of the previous assignments confusing because the difference isn't really clear to me. As I read deeper into the assignment I hope this will be cleared up.
Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day. 
 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz. I know we can go over past assignments and modules, but I think making a review guide with questions that are set up similarly to how they are going to be presented to us during the in class quiz would be extremely beneficial. 
 One thing that was confusing about today's class was do you account for criteria that isn't stated by the client in the problem statement or just in the table for criteria and constraints?
 I would've appreciated more time spent on how we are expected to empathize with different users.

"This whole assignees very interesting I greatly enjoy the using real world problems as o assignments
I found working on the assignment to be the most interesting because I was able to connect with my team members and for me I struggle with that. It felt nice to be able to work together to achieve a goal and I found it interesting how our ideas were flowing together.
I found the advice on how to do the activity incredibly helpful. My team was wrongly doing the activity, and without the clarification likely would have turned it in without meeting the requirements.
It was interesting to see how going over the pros and cons for an idea can change designs.

I enjoyed coming up with ideas and thought it was interesting to see how my teamates thoughts varied.
I was interested in seeing the evaluations that engineers use and how it was useful for us to make sure that the decisions made were the best one suited as the solution."
"I didn't get what materials i should use for prototype
Something that could use more details in today's class was the schedule with our new reading day, because you went over it kind of quick and I didn't catch all the dates.
What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)
I found it interesting the different types of modeling that could be used
How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one.","We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it.

"It was nice to meet my team and get some practice with for functions. The hot chocolate was also very cool.
I found it most interesting when we were talking about the concept quizzes and seeing the wide variety of answers you could have.
I was very interested in the concept quiz information as I found out about that if else functions are on the exam. I learned more about what if else functions do such that the order must be if else if then else then end or if else end. Else cannot come before elseif and the order is very important.
What I found interesting was the in class activity where we have implemented for loops using real life data for an example such as corn production.
Being able to sit with my class","I found the review of what would be on our quiz to be the most interesting today
I really enjoyed meeting with my team for the first time in person! This was our first in class activity as a group, and it was great to better develop our team dynamic
I was intrigued, yet again, by the various applications of MATLAB's efficient user interface to solve application problems in the real world.
I found the in class activity very interesting as we were using for loops within the real world. In addition, I noticed how useful MatLab can be in the real world.

"There was not much of anything really confusing today in class. In fact, the lecture was explained well and it was very detailed and explained precisely.
In todays class, the most confusing thing was the purpose of a main function. I think it would benefit the class if there was another example of why main functions are useful compared to only using a script and sub functions.
I was confused about why there is a 6 hour time limit on the concept quiz if we have access to the questions before opening Gradescope. Are we allowed to complete the problems and then open Gradescope, or do we have to have Gradescope open while completing the questions?
I wish we talked more about the structure of A10 in class
nothing","I was confused about how to begin the individual problem for A10. I did not understand how to find the center of mass from the equations they gave us
The part that was confusing was the main loop. I was confused because I was not sure if you could put the sub functions in the script of the main function, or if you just need to type the commands into the command window.
Needed help understanding the for loops a little more and the in class activity needed to be clearer
User defined functions are still a bit confusing in terms of how to format and work them.
