One thing that was a little confusing was the typing of certain symbols and formulas into Excel. For example, it was difficult for me to remember how to lock certain numbers as absolute values. Once I refreshed my memory I was able to get it because I did have experience with it while watching the pre-class videos, but it was a lot for me to remember. Also, I never figured out how to type the symbol for degrees with my keyboard into Excel. It was not a big deal, but I am guessing that learning that information will save me some time and energy in the future.
I was slightly confused about why the example problem in class today was a scatter plot, not a line graph. However, after speaking with my peers, the confusion was cleared up.
Some of the questions regarding numerical or categorical were sort of confusing; for example, if zip codes are categorical or numerical data. I searched it up online and understood it a bit more, but it would be nice if you could explain it in class.

I was a bit confused on the sorting topics as I have not worked with them for a while","Explaining the recursive algorithm for traversing the tree path. Also just going over brute force search again
I was a bit confused on the sorting topics as I have not worked with them for a while
Exactly how pruning is done was a little confusing. I think I have a decent idea of how to do it in theory but seeing an actual example would help.
You said you will make a video for this, but how to construct a tree is confusing because I have never done it.

"I found the suppressed and unsurpassed loops to be the most interesting.
It was hard to find anything interesting in class other than the in class activity. It basically timed suppressed and unsuppressed loops. We found that suppressed loops run quicker than unsuppressed loops
I found it most interesting how you could cut down the time a program takes to run by changing a loop to something else like by using find.
I liked how we are being introduced to more and more loops which therefore opens up more tools to use which will make coding more interesting.
Nested loops","I liked seeing the iterations done out so I could think about what the for and while loops were actually accomplishing.
I thought the tic-Toc function was interesting. I thought it was interesting because I did now know that there was a function that displayed the time it takes to function the function and display the answers.
I was intrigued by the speed difference that suppressing code makes. It's cool to see computing time actually being visualized.
I found it interesting how the vector form is faster than the for loop and how the suppressed code is faster than the unsuppressed code.
I found the in class activity the most interesting in todays class. I could genuinely tell that the activity was there for me to get better at complex loops. I also found it interesting how this was one of the harder lessons so far this semester yet it was the shortest lecture."
"The operations performed in the for and while loop examples on the board were a bit confusing because the computation kept getting messed up, but it was okay.
Tracking the number of loops in a compex loop
What was confusing was the difference between suppressed and unsuppressed code because this made the in class activity very difficult to get started.
The most confusing thing was the first problem of A11. I was confused on how the no loop would work efficiently
More info was needed on the process of using conditionals when converting loops to vector operations","Todays class was about complex loops. It was really hard for me to see the point in them. We basically eliminate loops that are designed to make our jobs easier such as for loops and while loops, and use other methods to get the same answer.
The operations performed in the for and while loop examples on the board were a bit confusing because the computation kept getting messed up, but it was okay.
I was confused that there is a way to do a for loop and a while loop in a nested structure. It was hard to learn how to use these as a vector.

"I did not realize that you can go back on to the same question when you clear your workspace. How long do you have to edit or resubmit your answers until you get a different variation of the question? Everything else was fine!
The due dates for some items are confusing because of how many things are going on. However I had some concerns lifted today after asking the teaching team. The lecture was very good otherwise.
I could use some more explanation on how to save matlab files. Although we do not need to save the files to submit the assignment, I would like to be able to save the files for future reference or in case I have a problem with submission. Also, some more review on inputing long equations would be helpful.
I couldn't keep up with the pace of the class because the teacher spoke a little fast today. I hope some key teachers can speak in a slow pace.Everything else is perfect and his/her help is timely.
I personally didn't feel like the class today was confusing, it just felt like to me that it was a little rushed.

I had a hard time figuring out where to access the Matlab files because they are stored in a different drive than where I keep the test of my schoolwork and related information.
I was sometimes confused with what is expected from us to do. For example, I did not find a lot of room to finish the In-class activity. It was expected from us to finish the activity but I have not heard the instruction to do so.

"I found the loading of the .p file using A00_skills using the PUID and problem number to get the information we need for the assignment.
I thought it was very interesting that MATLAB can solve equations completely differently depending on the order and organization of the numbers that are typed in.
MATLAB coding actually is pretty neat after I took the CS159, the commands do make sense in there and I can guess some of the unused commands as well
I was interested by the ease of use of MATLAB operations and it's interface itself. It is a very intuitive language to learn relative to JavaScript and C.
I found it interesting that question generators were created for this class rather than having pre-written questions.","I found learning about generating unique problems in Matlab insteresting.

The most interesting was doing the assignment 00. Even though the assignment was decently simple, I enjoyed putting commands into MATLAB and getting an output."
"I enjoyed learning how to build up a matrix in detail. I also found interesting is that how I  am able to edit a matrix based on commands in MatLab.
The most interesting thing was when I figured out how to replace the middle 5x5 matrix on one of the A05 questions.
The work time we had was nice, I learned a lot.
I was interested in how to manipulate vectors in matlab and find unique solutions to problems asked in the assignment
I really enjoyed working through the in class examples, and getting feedback from the TAs in real time.","I was very intrigued about matrices and that using matrixA (ones) you could produce a matrix with all ones and the easily use your code to test whether you could replace the right value or not.

Nothing, everything made sense
One thing I found a little confusing about the class was trying to get all of the software downloaded onto my computer to start the work.
What assignments are due when
The steps needed to run a .p file in MATLAB were confusing at first, but were clarified later on. Other than that the lecture was easy to understand.","I was a little confused on how to find the .p files, download them, and then run them in MATLAB. However, by the end of class I felt like I knew how to do it reasonably well.
I believe one piece of information the professor could have gone more in depth about is maybe showed us how to open the p file instead of going in depth on the arrays and everything. I think most students understood the matrixes and arrays very well, but the p file and saving that and creating a math lab function was confusing for first time programming users like me.
What matrices and arrays actually are- know how they look in matlab but are they just a way to set up data for calculations?
The process for finding and submitting assignments was slightly confusing.
Something that I need a little more information about is how to get extra credit. I was still a little confused."
