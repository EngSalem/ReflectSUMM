"I did not understand why the electric field inside of a solid, uniform, insulating sphere (rR).
I was confused about why we find the areas of the three different parts of the cylinder, and how we do this.
Nothing was too confusing. The only part I found a little difficult was the different gauss fields around the uniformly charged inner sphere. Just transitioning from one layer to the next for me slightly confused in your last example problem video.
More examples would be helpful for further understanding.
Are these the only three symmetries we will work with?","I did not understand why the electric field inside of a solid, uniform, insulating sphere (r<R) is greater than the field outside of it (r>R).
I think the idea and concepts make sense, but I am confused about what shapes to choose as the Gaussian surface. Can you choose any shape? Are there multiple shapes that will still give the same answer as the cylinder? Also, the conductor vs insulator in reference to Gauss' law is confusing to me
The second question on the concept quiz confused me, I wasn't sure how positive and negative charges being outside or inside affect flux.
I think the angle at which flux flows from an object is a bit confusing. The first problem on the concept quiz deals with this.
I was confused about why we find the areas of the three different parts of the cylinder, and how we do this."
"I like when we do problems together in class as it gives us an example on how we should start the top hat questions when we have to do them individually.
I found it interesting that a single sliver of a rod or ring with uniform charge can be used to calculate the entire electric field produced by the object
Definitely the electric field demonstrations we watched on youtube. It was really cool to see actual electric fields

"I really enjoy line integrals and I can tell that we're moving towards using them to calculate potential.
I thought it was interesting that Vnet is equal to all Vs added together
Collection of point charges (pairing them)
I found how conductors act to be interesting.
Nothing in particular today","I found equipotentials to be the most interesting thing, especially drawing a equipotentials for a dipole!
How we can calculate something so complicated as electrons passing through an area is very cool.
old concepts being brought back to explain new concepts
The most interesting thing was that finding electric potential doesn't require a path, but only the magnitude of the charge and it's distance from the point of interest.
I enjoyed learning more about the ex ey and es because it is similar to what I just learned tonight in calc 3 for solving integrations in third dimensions"
"I think the top hat questions with the electric fields were confusing because I don't think the answered were explained in depth enough
The math behind why certain numbers can be considered 0 or a simpler version confused me.
I was confused by how to calculate the moment for dipoles that are not in a uniform field.
the binomial theorem
I feel like it would benefit me to hear more about the simple charge distributions. There were some parts of the videos that seemed a bit confusing to me and i had some struggles solving the second question on concept quiz 3.","I found the physical properties of the electric field to be confusing. Like specifically how it relates to electric force.

"The direction of the vectors in the problem we solved in groups
The salami and tension forces in ropes are still somewhat confusing to envision
Understanding how the wrench appears to be moving differently relative to other objects. I think I'm overthinking what the weird relative really means.
Tension was very confusing in today's lecture
Nothing about the lecture was confusing today. All the problems were discussed thoroughly, and most of the time the wrong answers were debunked throughout the lecture. If something was at all confusing, I would've liked to spend a bit more time on inertial reference frames.","What was confusing for me today was the tug of war problem.  I was not sure about how it worked.  Although the explanation allowed me to understand it, i feel like i need more practice with types of problems like that.
I think some of the conceptual top hat questions were a bit confusing, jt was hard to relate the real life examples to the theory we learnedfrom the videos
I didn't understand the Newton's 2nd Law problems. I needed more explanation as to way objects appeared based on what they were relative .
The concept of inertial frames was confusing because I didn't understand why the wrench would appear to be accelerating forward but then i thought about what happens in a car and I got it.
 I was a little confused about the salami question when it was first shown, but the explanation helped."
"I think the explanations of average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration were a bit confusing based on the graph examples.
N/A; everything was explained well. I made some silly mistakes, but today's lecture reinforced the concepts that had slipped my mind.
The last example with the quadratic equation was confusing. I kept plugging in the numbers but was not getting the correct answer.
nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
Going in depth for more problems in class","I am still confused on a part of the dinosaur problem we discussed. Does each dinosaur have to have its own positive and negative direction or can one be used for the whole system?
I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”"
"I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics.
The last question we ran out of time
The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
Friction on an incline was what confused me. When more than one or two forces are applied, I feel like things are bound to get confusing.
block on block","I found the top hat question about the two blocks hanging from the pulley the most confusing just because I understood it when I set the tensions equal to each other but not conceptually 
 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today'slecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how todevelop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
The problems were pretty difficult in terms of understanding the fbds and what is happening to the system and i wish there was more time given overall even for the conceptual questions

"It was a little bit confusing figuring out how to edit the overflow data. Also, this is part of the Modules not the class but I don't understand why the center of a bin is not just the middle number of that bins range (in the module 31 was not the answer for the range 30-32).
How to make histograms was confusing. Jeff told our group in the breakout room that we have to base the histogram off of bin width, not bin number. This wasn't clear in the modules or lecture.
Determining the bin's upper limit and underflow
In today's class, it was unclear about whether the data in the in class activity was numerical or categorical or ordinal and nominal.

I found what exactly constitutes folksonomy to be a bit confusing. For example, I know that tags are inherent to the definition as well as a lack of hierarchy, but if we take the hashtag example from class, is there not a sense of hierarchy in terms of preference of the user for the tag. Is there not a hierarchy between the user and the folksonomy or perhaps the interface which presents the info to the user( though perhaps that falls more into the M.L. Realm).
One thing that was confusing was the difference between categorization types."
