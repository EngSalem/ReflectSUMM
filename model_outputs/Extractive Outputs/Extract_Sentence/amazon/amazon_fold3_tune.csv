"I was mostly confused about how to pick bounds for the integral in solving for potential energy. Ultimately, my answer for a question was wrong Bc I chose wrongly.
The concept addressed in the second concept question, regarding how fields are affected by other fields, was confusing.
The difference between the voltage potential energy, the potential energy and then regular volatage. I just kept getting lost with the symbols and meanings
I found it confusing when to set the initial potential to zero.
Overall more examples, not necessarily solving but the setup, would be helpful as well as more explanation of dipoles and their potential energy","The integral part and the last problem that we did. I am always confused about how to set up the problem.
The potential energy of the field was confusing.

"I found grounding to be very confusing; what does it mean for a circuit to be grounded?
why it is useful to have a reference point. i am confused about what exactly delta V is
The most confusing thing for me was when we went over the 2 different cases of grounding. I just found it confusing when going over the formulas like whether to add or subtract Ir
I'm confused about how the spot where we place a ground affects how we measure voltage
The sapling question about finding emf and internal resistance has me stumped. If we could go over more of these that would be awesome.","The idea of grounding was confusing for me. I feel like seeing some more examples would be helpful.
Problem 27.54 with the car motor problem was confusing. I did not understand what the starting motor does. Does it withdraw or add voltage? Does it act as a resistor or a battery? Otherwise your lectures were clear and concise as always.
I am still a bit confused about why the voltage was negative in the first given example even though the voltage coming out of the battery is positive.
Current for the last top hat circuit question that was graded
Re-drawing circuit diagrams with grounds seems  to get complicated when multiple branches and resistors/capacitors are involved."
"The explanation of centripetal force was interesting.
I found it interesting for the terminal velocity and the acceleration is zero
When we compared the drag force and gravity from air to water
I found the explanation of drag force most interesting because it is a topic O have never covered before.
I thought that the skier and the pendulum free body diagrams were interesting, how the acceleration pointed towards the center","I found the centripetal force problems to be very interesting. I usually enjoy relating centripetal force to conceptual ideas, so I enjoyed thatpart of the lecture.
 The terminal velocity question was also kinda cool because it explained why you can't just jump into water safely at large heights. 
The most interesting thing in today's lecture was calculating the acceleration a person feels when they hit the water from jumping from an airplane.  It showed that the body cannot stand such a massive increasein acceleration .
 The first few top hat problems about the steel ball vs the ping pong ball. Interesting real life examples.
I found the explanation of drag force most interesting because it is a topic O have never covered before."

I enjoyed group tests simply because people can guide my ideas and help me get the answer."
"Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
I found conceptualizing relative forces a bit confusing but the computation was easy
I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.","Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
I need to work on using the correct kinematics equation. The concept of relative motion is confusing, because I can't understand reference views."
"One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why.
How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)
I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more.","How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees.
Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it.

"I liked creating the problem set by picking out information from the email.
The different zoom meeting calls provided well needed communication and ways to bounce ideas off.
Differences between types of data and talking to new people in breakout groups
I actually found chat the most interesting as I explored and helped other students resolve issues for the downloads on Excel. It was satisfing to watch the class work together in the background to stay on the same page.
I found that seeing all the bike share data was most interesting.","I also found learning about excel to be interesting.
 I had never heard of problem statements so that was interesting to learn.
How engineers look at data and decide on how to solve any issues they find from the data.
The detailed projects that make up the class
 I enjoyed meeting new people in my breakout rooms and seeing what they drew for the in class activity."
"Nothing was confusing at all this class. The largest concern was the exam 1 grades which was resolved.
I'm sure a lot of people are saying this, but the in class activity had the wrong numbers compared to when the answers were shown after submission. That created some confusion, but I still knew how to do it, even with the wrong numbers.
I was confused about how to calculate the amount of CO2 emissions in grams per mile because the brightspace PowerPoint slides were confusing.

"A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful.
More in depth about how to make more complicated histograms
Excel is still confusing to use.
i didn't understand that the histograms didn't need the date so i spent the whole break out room confused. I also think the breakout rooms should've been longer.
There was nothing confusing in the class today for me. I thought everything was explained very well.","A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful.
The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped.
I wish we saw the slide you were talking about that had al the due dates so we didn't have to find it later
The underflow and overflow was confusing for the bins.
The instructions for the in class assignment wasn't posted in the chat until near the end of the breakout room. This made the assignment difficult to complete."
"It was interesting to see how far the pros and cons identification  could go ( the price of phone customer service, etc)
The most interest part was researching biomimicry for the design project.  I was looking into what animals and insects build bridges and how they are attracted to light.
I found it interesting comparing a french press and a keurig
I thought that brainstorming was interesting, it is fun to try and create new ideas.
I thought it was interesting we got so much time to work and we also did a relevant sample of what we'd be doing in A17.","It was interesting to me how we listed out all these different prosandcons for each solution to figure out what would work best for us! 
learning about the specific types of design prototyping strategies

"I found it interesting that time can be both continuous or discrete data depending on the context it is used in. For example, in the bike problem, the time is seen as discrete, as bike usage is recorded at certain hours of the day and cannot be determined for any times in between these.
I found the way histograms are able to fit data points into bins interesting.
Difference between the graphs
I think the practice with histograms was really important because it cleared up a lot of my confusion and I feel like I understand it much better now.
Histograms and line charts can both be used to show patterns in data where the data are, for example, the total number of bikers during each hour of the day.","I think the review of graphs was very interesting as it helped clarify the differences between them.
Talking about how to create a histogram in excel because excel can be confusing to work with so this was really helpful.

 I enjoyed working with my group to complete the assignments because we got to work together and finish the work as a group"
"I am still unclear about where we can find further information for the problem statement in our final project.
Nothing. Everything was clear. The directions for the breakout groups was not rushed and I was able to discuss the data from the graph with my group mates
At this point, the things I have the most issue with are basic technical things. I never did much with Excel or computers in high school, so saving and submitting is challenging occasionally.
what was due and what we were suppose to be doing. no supervision or someone to ask
I did not find anything particularly confusing or unclear  this class","I think where to find our assignments, when they are due, what we have to do when is confusing.
The in-class activity was slightly confusing as to what the instructions were and what was wanted in the assignment.
The thing that I struggled with the most was just navigating Excel. I don't have a whole lot of experience with it, so it is going to take some practice to get the hang of it.
I thought some of the break rooms were a bit short especially the one where we first got assigned to our teams and had the excel project to work on. Everything else moved nicely

"The most interesting part of today's class was how engineers work effectively with problem scoping to properly define a project.
I thought it was interesting when we were talking about the difference between experienced and novice designers.
I found the fact that stakeholders, clients, and end-user can change based on perspective of the project to be very interesting. Based on what you're doing, you may have different people or groups for each of them.
I found it interesting to learn about the new project and work with the others in my group to accomplish what is due for friday.
Before today's class I was really confused on who a stakeholder was. Today's class really clarified that for me. It was interesting to have it clarified bc I'd been confused on it for so long.","I liked the discussion on the importance of problem scoping and the differences between novice and professional engineers. Particularly asking questions and research.
The breakout room was very fun and informative! We met Jeff Hall today, and he was extremely helpful. We love working in a team and we're excited for the upcoming project. 
What I found most interesting in today's class was how a client or end user was a stakeholder always but a stakeholder could be a client or end user, but is not necessarily always one. 
 The start of a new projects is always interesting I feel that seeing how a project could be integrated so close to me is one of the most exciting things about being an engineer

I think that the instructions for what to do with the PGO data in the M3 part of the project were unclear.
I thought that a lot of the instructions were unclear for M3. Part 0 asks for strengths and limitations of our algorithm, and then asks us how we will utilize the feedback we received to change our algorithm. However, we did not get any feedback on our algorithm, and we did not lose any points on our algorithm. Also, we were addressed by a TA that said that we needed to use the given V0 values for the new enzyme to calculate Vmax and Km, not our algorithm calculated V0 values. This is not inherently obvious, and is a very important distinction to make. The instructions need to be clearer.
