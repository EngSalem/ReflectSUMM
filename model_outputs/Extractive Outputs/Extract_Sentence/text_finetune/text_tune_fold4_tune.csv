"We can calculate the numeric value of complicated electrical concepts in physics.
Solving for the time it takes for electrons to move from a car battery to the starter motor and understanding that the result does not need to be a small number in order for the car to start, since there is still a lot of current flowing to the the motor.
I thought it was interesting creating the series scenarios. It's sort of engaging cresting your own picture of a circuit.
I found the parallel capacitors interesting because you are able to combine capacitors together when they are parallel to each other
I thought the example about the lightning bolt hitting the water was really cool. I also thought that the difference the current flows through saltwater and freshwater was interesting, even though it wasn't supposed to be part of our lesson.","I found it interesting how we are now drawing our circuits in series and parallel.

"Dielectric strength of air explaining how much electric field is needed for lightning to strike
I thought that the dielectrics were very cool just because it seems like it is going beyond just math. The concept of a circuit with a battery was also interesting.
Dielectrics were interesting. Especially the physics of weaker dielectrics creating a dipole moment within the atoms despite it obviously having less forces to work with.
The use of a switch board, batteries, and all those things are confusing but are very interesting! Also it is getting harder to write these.

"The integral equation. I think more examples would help
This lesson was so much clearer to understand than my high school lesson on flux. It was neat how you tied together both flux and gauss's law seamlessly. I had a really tough time last year trying to understand gauss's law.
I think that I struggled with figured out the electric flux using the integral. I also was confused on when doing the gauss' law problems how you chose the proper surface to use.
Choosing a Gaussian surface. I had trouble answering the last question on concept Quiz for gauss law.
I thought that the explanation with the last practice problem was kind of confusing. I still am not sure what the total induced charge is.","In the example problem, you would pull numbers and I was not sure where the numbers would be from. Could you be more clear on where these numbers would be coming from in class?
Choosing a Gaussian surface. I'm still not sure what types/orientations of surfaces produce symmetry that allow certain components to cancel out.
I found the whole concept of flux very unclear. I didn't really grasp it on the fundamental level and the mathematical interpretation of the concept doesn't make sense to me.
I was confused how to calculate the direction of the area vector.
The part that confused me the most was when we were looking at a conductor and an insulator and trying to figure out the electric field value of each shell."

I think the example pertaining to the charges arranged in a square was a little confusing. Particularly deriving the r value."
"The thing that I found most interesting in today's lecture was the practice problem that required us to find the second force acting on the object.
The tug of rope scenario. This was interesting because the tension between the two pullers depends on both not just the stronger one.
I found how tension is the same in the whole rope to be interesting.
How the wrench in the spaceship keeps moving in the same direction as long as nothing acts upon it. All the problems that went along with the wrench
I liked the alien and spaceship top hat question that depends on your reference and how it can relate to being in a car.","I found most of the top hat questions interesting and I feel like they help solidify the concepts that we are going over

The only problem was accessing CourseMIRROR.
I would have liked to know more about how the projects would generally work, especially in this new environment. I also would have liked more information on our upcoming assignments because, at least to me, I felt I was dropped into a situation of researching a company and going through their data without any idea of how to do it properly because this would be my first time attempting anything like this, especially without prior instruction and/or examples to guide me or at the very least tell me how I can do something “right”.","I'm still a little confused about when assignments are due and what we are responsible for before next class?
The schedule and process that each class is going to follow. Its confusing how we will go between activities and work time.

I found that the amount of carbon that a car with “good gas mileage” was interesting because it seemed large.
Trade offs in design was interesting, and I like how we delved into climate impacts and calculated our own carbon footprints to see what our impct on the planet was.
I found the class activity the most interesting. This was because it involved our own lives with our own cars.

"The class wasn't confusing today. The only part of the class that I found somewhat confusing was the In-Class Assignment. The directions were relatively straightforward but slightly confusing based off how they were conveyed.
I was confused on what parts we had to complete on assignment 16. After talking to my team we were able to figure it out!!
The problem statement that we wrote for the in class activity was confusing because I wasn't sure at first what we were writing it about. It took a while for me to figure out it was about the assignment 16.
Everything was explained well. My group faced a bit of confusion regarding what parts of the document A16 contained, but that was cleared up once Jeff visited our breakout room.
The assignment 16 expectations were confusing because there were conflicting messages in different places in brightspace. This needed clarification.","The part of A16 where we are tasked to come up with questionsandresponses is confusing because of the little amount of time we havetogain actual answers.

i didn't understand that the histograms didn't need the date so i spent the whole break out room confused. I also think the breakout rooms should've been longer.","A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful.
The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped.
I wish we saw the slide you were talking about that had al the due dates so we didn't have to find it later
The underflow and overflow was confusing for the bins.
The instructions for the in class assignment wasn't posted in the chat until near the end of the breakout room. This made the assignment difficult to complete."

The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
Everything made sense into today's class. But I wish there was more explanation to the ways we could create prototypes if the software option was not available to use. Other than that, everything made sense.
Prototyping","We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to ourseparation.
How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment.
I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.

assignment a09 seems interesting
I was very interested in the concept quiz information as I found out about that if else functions are on the exam. I learned more about what if else functions do such that the order must be if else if then else then end or if else end. Else cannot come before elseif and the order is very important.","I found the review of what would be on our quiz to be the most interesting today
I really enjoyed meeting with my team for the first time in person! This was our first in class activity as a group, and it was great to better develop our team dynamic
