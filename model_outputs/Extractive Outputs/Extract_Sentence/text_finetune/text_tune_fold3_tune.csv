"The integral part and the last problem that we did. I am always confused about how to set up the problem.

The concept addressed in the second concept question, regarding how fields are affected by other fields, was confusing.
Overall more examples, not necessarily solving but the setup, would be helpful as well as more explanation of dipoles and their potential energy"
"conceptually, I was a little confused how you can have a ground before a resistor, making the voltage zero, and that doesn't impact the energy continuing on. Mathematically I can see why this is true, but conceptually it's a bit confusing.
I am still a bit confused about why the voltage was negative in the first given example even though the voltage coming out of the battery is positive.
Finding the emf was confusing.
why it is useful to have a reference point. i am confused about what exactly delta V is
Figuring out how grounding will affect the potential","The idea of grounding was confusing for me. I feel like seeing some more examples would be helpful.
Problem 27.54 with the car motor problem was confusing. I did not understand what the starting motor does. Does it withdraw or add voltage? Does it act as a resistor or a battery? Otherwise your lectures were clear and concise as always.

"I thought that the skier and the pendulum free body diagrams were interesting, how the acceleration pointed towards the center
The most interesting thing in today's lecture was calculating the acceleration a person feels when they hit the water from jumping from an airplane.  It showed that the body cannot stand such a massive increase in acceleration .
I just like the fact that we are finally putting in air resistance as a factor... throughout high school we never would factor it in and I like learning about terminal velocity
I found the explanation of drag force most interesting because it is a topic O have never covered before.
I thought the question of whether throwing something was faster than terminal velocity was interesting","I found the centripetal force problems to be very interesting. I usually enjoy relating centripetal force to conceptual ideas, so I enjoyed thatpart of the lecture.
 The terminal velocity question was also kinda cool because it explained why you can't just jump into water safely at large heights.

"I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
Nothing was confusing today. It was all intro physics that I have learned my senior year. I definitely needed to brush up on it though because we had off from school for so long. That's how I feel about most of my classes though.
I found conceptualizing relative forces a bit confusing but the computation was easy
The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.","Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.

I need to work on using the correct kinematics equation. The concept of relative motion is confusing, because I can't understand reference views."
"I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos.
I thought today's class went very well. I do not think that I did not misunderstand any of the topics discussed during the class. I found the problem we did in breakout rooms very helpful because it allowed for my group and I to think for ourselves.
Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right?
Today's lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture.
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out","How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees.
Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it.
Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)"

"Test
It was interesting in today's class to learn about how to create histograms in excel and how to format them properly.
I found it interesting that time can be both continuous or discrete data depending on the context it is used in. For example, in the bike problem, the time is seen as discrete, as bike usage is recorded at certain hours of the day and cannot be determined for any times in between these.

I felt as if the last problem regarding the two blocks could have had a little bit more detail.

It was interesting to discuss how to deal with errors when we were calculating parameters: v0, Vmax, and Km.","The ways to find the km and Vmax were interesting since they all have different advantages and disadvantages.
The use of user defined functions in order to find the values of V0 and Km
Working with my teammates to make looping processes to average out the v0 values for tests and test repeats was confusing but interesting.
I found out that taking a very small percentage of data to calculate v0 actually creates a worst graph like .5%.

"The different plots that we need to submit to m3 in different parts of the milestone we're not well explained
What M3 is supposed to be? The difference between table 5 a and table 5 b was confusing.
The milestone 3 was confusing because our team was struggling whether to compare enzymes from milestone 2 with the PG0-X50 or if we should apply our method from M2 to calculate the v naught values of PG0-X50.
I thought that a lot of the instructions were unclear for M3. Part 0 asks for strengths and limitations of our algorithm, and then asks us how we will utilize the feedback we received to change our algorithm. However, we did not get any feedback on our algorithm, and we did not lose any points on our algorithm. Also, we were addressed by a TA that said that we needed to use the given V0 values for the new enzyme to calculate Vmax and Km, not our algorithm calculated V0 values. This is not inherently obvious, and is a very important distinction to make. The instructions need to be clearer.
The instructions for M3 were very confusing and could have been more clear about when the reference values were used and when the calculated values were used.","The instructions for M3 were very confusing and could have been more clear about when the reference values were used and when the calculated values were used.
