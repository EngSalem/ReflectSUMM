"i found the open ended top hat questions interesting because they required multiple concepts to be applied which made it all seem more connected and easier to understand conceptually
The experiment when when could see the diopole, and the whole concept of polar molecules like water.
How dipoles give molecules their unique properties
I love math so it was a relief to see Taylor series. I also enjoy the connections between chemistry like K and dipole dipole moments in water molecules
I found shell's theorem to be the most interesting part about today's lecture.","In today's class, I found it interesting that electric fields work how wind works. I learned that wind has many vectors as does electric fields.
The experiment when when could see the diopole, and the whole concept of polar molecules like water.
Torque and potential energy and how they apply to electric fields
How dipoles give molecules their unique properties
visualizing electric fields. Drawing abstract concepts makes them easier to understand."
"the integrations were confusing but i think i just need to focus more and review calc
The second question on the concept quiz gave me issues and made me pretty confused, especially when it came to setting up the integral.
I am really having trouble setting up integrals for the electric field. I don't understand how to set it up given the linear density and the charge.
The limits on the integrals confused me the most. I did not know why some of them changed midway through the problem.
I am confused on how to figure out what dq should be in example problems that use that equation","The ring of charge section was the most confusing. Setting it up and finding E parallel and E perpendicular was the most confusing for me
While I understand the solving the integral process, I could use more clarity/examples of setting up integrals in different situations. Also, a deeper explanation of what exactly is happening to the electric field when influenced by an extended charge.
I felt the lecture was going too fast and felt that we should go over details more rather than flying through each tophat question.
I am really having trouble setting up integrals for the electric field. I don't understand how to set it up given the linear density and the charge.
The initial set up. Specifically the limits of integration and the variable of integration."
"The computer circuit was the most interesting part of class today because I would never be able to understand that in my life.
i liked that no matter which path you took to find current in a circuit, you'll get the same value.
I thought grounding was interesting. I never understood what grounding meant before.
Voltmeters and ammeters are really interesting in that I think it's cool that we can actually measure these concepts (voltage and current) pretty easily
How ammeters and voltmeters play a role in circuits","The amount of info we can determine from a simple circuit with proper analysis is very cool.
I thought grounding was interesting. I never understood what grounding meant before.
I found the ammeters and voltmeters interesting because they can both be used in the same circuit but for different reasons.
i liked that no matter which path you took to find current in a circuit, you'll get the same value.
I found it interesting using the loop rule to solve the last problem because it made the problem more simple than I initially thought."
"In today's class I found it confusing how the units work between charge and capacitance and electric potential. I found it confusing what a farad is.
Calculating cylindrical capacitors
In video 2, why did U and V start at the same place?
Are capitators used specifically in circuits are can they be observed in nature.
I'm a bit confused by how the equations relate together so more explanation and examples would be great.","one thing that was confusing for me was the actual calculations regarding the topic. I was a bit confused on that part of the concept quiz.
The difference between the two variables that use U was very confusing. How energy relates to capacitance just wasn't clear to me.
Calculating cylindrical capacitors
In video 2, why did U and V start at the same place?
In today's class I found it confusing how the units work between charge and capacitance and electric potential. I found it confusing what a farad is."
"I found resistors in series fairly confusing just because I find myself getting tripped up with how to add voltage in the series.
Resistors
I think find emf and voltage difference could be gone over a little more. Maybe an example with a diagram instead of graph would benefit us more conceptually
The conceptual tophat questions about current vs voltage were most confusing for me because I don't fully understand the relationship between the two.
More examples and discussion of differences between conductors, semiconductors etc","It wasn't confusing, but I think going over Ohm's law and when you can and can't use it would be helpful
I found resistors in series fairly confusing just because I find myself getting tripped up with how to add voltage in the series.
I thought the examples at the end of the cuvids for the first set were a little confusing, I wasn't sure how the equations were derived
the relationship between the internal voltage of a battery vs. the external voltage.
Trying to figure out if things are in series or parallel"
"Deciding between parallel and series
I thought that it was a little confusing why in the 1st example you performed you added the non matching capacitance (C3) with C2 and plugged that into the expression. and on our sapling concept quiz, we instead used expression (C1*C2)/(C1+C2)+ C3.  why were we allowed to do that for that problem and not this one? genuinely confused.
The difference in using the formula c1*c2/c1+c2 vs using the equation for parallel capacitance or series capacitance confuses me a bit on the concept quiz.
I found it confusing defining what C equivalence was.
Simplifying circuit diagrams by re-orienting capacitors is still a bit unclear to me when there are many different branches involved.","I'm a little confused on how charge is distributed on capacitors in series vs capacitors in parallel.
I thought that it was a little confusing why in the 1st example you performed you added the non matching capacitance (C3) with C2 and plugged that into the expression. and on our sapling concept quiz, we instead used expression (C1*C2)/(C1+C2)+ C3. why were we allowed to do that for that problem and not this one? genuinely confused.
I was confused about how you know when capacitors are in parallel with each other.
The only thing I felt was kind of confusing was charge density. In lecture, you said that current density and the electric field went in opposite directions and I found that slightly perplexing.
The current density was the most confusing for me because I was just a bit confused on how to set up the integral."
"I enjoyed going over answers and work during the breakout room session for the one top hat question.
The most interesting material in this lecture was using unit vectors to easily add each component of a vector to find its total length.
I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy to follow.
The format. I've never had a flipped class like this one so it was unusual to have the small time for review and then immediately in to problem solving. I've also never heard vector addition described with the principle of moving backwards along one arrow and that that's why you subtract it (rather than in reference to the idea that origin doesn't matter and therefore whatever the starting location is should be subtracted out from every piece)
It was very entertaining which makes it a lot easier to pay attention too","I thought vector additions was the most interesting because of the easy system of steps that need to be followed to solve problems. I really like when things are laid out clearly and the steps are easy tofollow. 
I was most interested by the break out groups because it allowed us to work on the question together. If one person was stuck we could ask another for help and it's nice to have a peer help sometimes because they have a different viewpoint from the professor or TAs.
The examples that were given in class were very informative and I felt like they helped me with the overall course content. I personally feel like it was important for me to see those examples
 I really enjoyed the way class was formatted! I like that we aren't just repeating the book/notes we took ahead of time. I am fully engaged inpractice problems, and thus find them more interesting.
 I enjoyed using Top Hat because it kept me active during the lesson."
"I thought setting up the free body diagrams was challenging at times.  This is because I was sometimes confused on knowing where to place my force vectors.
When using gravity in equations for free body diagrams, why is it represented a positive instead of negative?
How you could put more than one object in a system
doubling the force of tension
I'm a bit confused on the most efficient way to solve for a variable","The problem that involved the man pulling himself up on a pulley was difficult to understand.  If the man is pulling down with the same forceas the tension, shouldn't that cancel out one of the tensions ?
The top hat problem with the 3 blocks. We covered this towards the end, and as we were crunched for time, I thought the problem wasn't discussed as much as I would've liked. 
In today's lecture, I was bit confused by the free body diagram of friction. How would friction change if the normal force was at an angle to the horizontal? 
The fact of there being two tensions confused me for one of the first questions we did. I didn't quite get the 2T, but I think I understand it now after it was explained. 
 Force magnitudes when there are multiple masses such as a person pushing on three rocks. It's just sometimes confusing on which masses to add or the exact forces acting on the masses."
"I think it was really clear. However, I would have liked if the TA's came to the breakout rooms so that we can all discuss about the career WDM. I think they know valuable information.
Nothing was confusing, there was a good explanation of weighted decision matrixes.
I wasn't completely sure about what to do for the in class activity because the template had a lot of slots to fill out but we only had to do some of it, but it wasn't completely clear about what parts we were supposed to do.
I was very confused by what was supposed to go onto criteria and what was supposed to go into metrics. The difference between the two was not clear.
The WDM was a little confusing. I was confused with the xsl file format. And the text towards the bottom.","The due date of assignment 18 was confusing 
I was a little confused about what to put as the metrics in the weighted decision matrix at first. 
Part of the decision matrix discussion was a little confusing on all of the different aspects that were needed in parts one, two, and three. 
I was a little confused on how to choose my criteria for the in class activity.
 I wasn't completely sure about what to do for the in class activity because the template had a lot of slots to fill out but we only had todo some of it, but it wasn't completely clear about what parts we were supposed to do."
"The class was a good class. There wasn't anything particularly interesting but at the same time there wasn't anything boring. I enjoyed the amount of time we were given to work with our groups near the end.
I found it interesting how we can use the r and r squared along with a trend like to see just how accurate we are.
What I found most interesting is the different equations used to determine whether a trend line matches the data well or not
I liked revisiting how a linear regression in least squares method is calculated and evaluated.
Knowing how to use and model equations with the laminar approach was helpful with understanding our data.","The linear regression was fun to learn about.
Learning about the values of r and how they relate to the accuracy of a trend line
Working with my group on both the in class assignment and the A10 assignment.
I enjoyed talking about regression lines correlations and playing the correlation game.
I found it interesting that it is so easy to do complex, helpful calculations in Excel."

The instructions for the skittle counting activity were confusing because the data we were supposed to use was found on a different place than all the rest of the data and instructions for the activity.
I found z-scores and talking about standard deviation and area under the curve confusing. I'm not sure what it all represents and how to use those numbers to interpret data
The deadlines for all the assignments were confusing, and the probability was a little confusing at first
Using excel is still very confusing.","The directions for the skittles activity in class were sort of confusing at first, but our team figured out what needed to be done
Assignment 08 was confusing because the directions were not clear. I had my hand raised in the breakout room and no one came.
I didn't quite fully grasp what z tables were and how do we figure out what values to use for funding the numbers
The formulas that we went over today are somewhat confusing to me. Other than that I thought class was very good!
I am still confused about how to create and use histograms and the shortcuts for using excel. The normal distribution questions are also confusing."
"I was confused on the feedback part of assignment 17. I was not really sure where the feedback was coming from. After my team and I talked to my TA it was a lot clearer!
The most confusing part of today was figuring out where and who we would be getting feedback from.  Since we didn't have feedback yet we were confused what we should use for part 5.
It was confusing what part V was supposed to resemble and what iteration #1 meant. It was confusing that there was no explanation for this assignment.
I was a little confused on how to make a pros and cons list at first.
You mentioned m31 being due next friday, I thought we were closer to m40. but I will check the due dates and make sure I get the right modules complete.","How much of The iteration we are supposed to do for A17
Hearing about the first iteration feedback left us without a real answer.
It is confusing on what we are supposed to build for our prototypes.
I was confused on which assignment we were supposed to be doing because online it said 5,6 but it was fixed.
I was confused at what parts of the project we actually need to complete."
"i understood everything that the professor spoke about today.
Due dates for assignment 10
for a10 how do we get measurements for the model. I have my shape overlayed on the model, but do I just go ahead and use the google maps scale to gather the information and call it an assumption or this more of a give piece of data.
This class was sort of smooth sailing. I was able to have enough time doing everything so I do not believe that it was too confusing.
More feedback on our submitted work.","My team was confused when looking at the assignment 10. We didn't know how we should make the mathematical/physical models. I think we should go over that next class.
More feedback on our submitted work.
I did not understand the APA style of notation. In this class, I have gotten points taken off for having the assignment in APA. I cannot find a resource to how to make these references correctly.
 The date which assignment A10 is due was the most confusing part about the lecture today.
How to perform some of the calculations on the assignment given."
"I thought the project we are working on is interesting
I found the equation for payback periods very useful and very applicable.
Learning about pay back time was interesting to me
There wasn't much to be interested in or uninterested in, since most of the class was working on the project. I suppose seeing the equations relating to investments was moderately enticing.
learning about how to calculate a cost recovery for a big purchase","I found the ability to find the payback time really interesting becauseit is a very useful thing to know when you are talking about budgeting.
 Learning about how long a captial investment will payoff was interesting , because we might use it later on.

"What is required for assignment A10
Nothing was really confusing except how we were put in breakout rooms for a bit and then taken out of them for an announcement that could have just be typed in chat so we didn't have to leave breakout rooms. It would have let us keep our train of thought
There was nothing confusing in today's class.
The most confusing part of todays class was figuring out part 5 for assignment A10.  Learning about the laminar approach and trying to describe was confusing.
I was a little confused about how to transfer the data table in A11, but I ended up just typing it out.","I think that the laminar approach needed some more explanation. I could relatively understand it but I could not explain what it is used for. Hopefully some confusions could be cleared next class.
The most confusing thing was calculating the regression constant value.
The explanation on how to use SSE, SST, and r to analyze data was confusing.
What was required for assignment 10 is confusing because of what was mentioned at the end. 
at first going over the trend lines was confusing, especially with the r^2 values and the sst and sse. i still dont really understand the sstand sse, but now after working on A11 i understand trendlines better"
"Being able to find the z-score and calculate it was the most interesting thing in today's class to me. It is interesting how you can use that to solve problems.
I thought the skittles activity was interesting

I liked how we had a lot of time to work on assignment 7. Also the in class assignment was very fun to hear about everyone's different graph types.
I found that spider chart that describes what chart we are supposed to use with what data very helpful and interesting
I enjoyed learning excel. It's a great tool and has a high learning curve which I'm excited to get better at it.
The thing I found most interesting is how and when to use histograms.","I liked using the histogram to measure frequency, which occurs often in data.

"How oversights in the engineering of structures can lead to massive failures
Working on the in class activity was interesting because I got to research the TAUM Sauk failure.
I found the engineering failures for the Taum Sauk reservoir to be an insightful example of how engineering projects can go badly based on negligence and lack of proper ethics by engineers involved in orchestrating it.
I enjoyed the discussion about engineering failures. I wish we had spent more time on discussing what choices resulted in the failures.
It was a straightforward and informational lesson with work time, and thus did not have much interesting or now knowledge.","I found it interesting that such little flaws in engineering design orcommunication can lead to such drastic and catastrophic failures ofmechanisms and projects. It really shows the importance of goodcommunication, documentation, and considering all possible perspectives.
i found it interesting to work in groups and in teams
 I found it interesting the amount of power we calculated for the amount of homes in assignment A12
The failures of the Taum Sauk reservoir was interesting and the fact that cutting corners backfired
I found the discussion over real world disasters to be interestingbecause it showed how the actions of engineers could have ramificationsoutside of not getting a good grade."
"Parts 4 and 5 of assignment A10 are very confusing. My team and I have all read the “background/technical content” several times.

How do we approximate the surface area at various depths without information on the geometry of the reservoir?
I found some of the concepts slightly underdeveloped with regards the the complications involved in our calculations for this project
I thought that I might need alittle help with setting up the mathematic models
I may have just missed it, however, I did find it confusing how to use the percent grade to calculate the height of the pipe in the in class activity. Nevertheless, one of the PT guys was able to clear this up and help me with the issue. I was just making it too complicated.","Creating models was definitely confusing and could use more explanations in the future. I felt like I need additional guidance finding the best approach when trying to create a model and how to improve models to make it the best possible.
The thing that was confusing today was trying to figure out a mathematical model that fit the slope change of the reservoir. It was confusing because it is difficult to picture a function that would map all of this information.
I would've appreciated if we went over the laminar approach in more depth. It was unclear what our excel file should look like.

The linear regression slides were very confusing to me however after doing the excel activity it is straightforward and i understand the concepts taught","Simple linear regression needed more details, especially as it relates to what the r squared value does.
Assignment 11 needed more explanation. Specifically, I struggled with the wording of particular questions. If the problems were more descriptive I would have understood the questions much easier.
Proper was to calculate the surface area to find volume
We could have gone over the laminar approach more because the regression line information seemed pretty easy to understand based on the module videos.
What will be covered in Exam 1"
"The thing I found most important in today's class is that the mathematical model doesn't have to be specific to one answer and is based on the preference of the person making it. However, such preferences can alter the accuracy of the calculations made based on the model.
What I found interesting about today's class was how there are so many different models to depict a system.

Something confusing was the the specific sections due in assignment A16, because the work given in the assignment is far too much to be due in one day. 
 Something that could have used more details in today's class was how to study for the in class quiz.

I felt like there were not enough nested loop problems in the class slides. Additionally, I needed more practice on this.
I was confused about what we needed to solve for in A10 problem two. There were sections of the body described that I had no idea where they were followed by equations I didn't know how to interpet."
"What was confusing was whether a low SSE value meant a better fit or a low SST value meant a better fit because I was confused as to which values determine what about the line.
I found a bit of the equations to be confusing for e during the in class activity, but overall the slides helped a lot!
One thing that was slightly confusing was using the matlab functions to find the line and equation of best fit.

The first part of assignment 12 was confusing. I feel like the directions were not clear on what to do. Although I got it done, I had to redo a couple of parts because I misunderstood the directions.","I was a little confused on the concept behind r^2 and why that is the calculation
I thought it was slightly confusing trying to figure out how to download the png files for the in class activity.

"What was confusing was the way for loops were taught. I learned for loops in a different way and I feel like they could be explained much easier.
The in class activity could have used a few more tips to starting the process of solving.
nothing
It was slightly confusing trying to figure out the for loop of the in class activity. I think it would have been more helpful to get more hints for that.
I was a little confused with how to do the ICA with a for loop, as I thought it would be more efficient to use a while loop, but I figured it out eventually.","One thing that I was confused about was how to do the in class activity. I was confused about using a for loop Inside a for loop to add up each of the 3 years.

"I was a little confused on how the best way to make a function not have an output when doing linear regression in the function.
I was confused about the difference between the fprintf command and the display command. I've been using fprintf to display my results on the assignments but I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be using the display command instead since the instructions say ""display results to command window.""
What was confusing was whether a small SSE or a small SST meant that the line of best fit had better correlation because it seemed like a small version of both is better
Exam prep
polyfit lines","Todays class was pretty straightforward. It was taking what we knew about sse, sst, and r squared values and applied it to matlab. However, I was a little confused the polyfit and polyval functions. I used them correctly thanks to the help of my teammate, but other than the minimal information given in the pre class video, I was pretty lost.
There was not a lot of new information this class, but I guess one of the more confusing things was the matlab syntax with the new graphing and best fit functions
I thought it was slightly confusing on A12 trying to figure out what data we should use for problem 2 on carbon dioxide.
In todays lecture I was confused about the goodness of fit on how to calculate the SSE as I know the formula however I am not sure what f(xi) really means and what is f(xi) how do you calculate it from the data or just given a graph with no line of best fit or r^2.
I would have liked more details about the upcoming concept quiz and A12, especially since we only have one more class before spring break."
"Main function calling subfunctions
the team activity
I found the A10 assignment itself interesting, I liked calculating the pool volume and found doing it was a lot easier with user defined functions.

I like that we r getting into more group work now.","I was interested how the main function is used to clean up your code and organize your user defined functions
I found the discussion of sub functions to be the most interesting. It was interesting because it allowed us to create main functions that call upon sub functions in order to run.

"I couldn't hear anything from the zoom meeting, so I'm sure I missed quite a bit. I don't know if the ica is a group activity, and if it is, I don't have a good way to contact my team. I also don't know what my team number is.
I think the way to use if statements was confusing.
i was confused about what the elseif command is used for specifically. my group helped me figure it out thoigh.
I think it might be better to talk more about what should we do during the breakout room. Since it took awhile for our team to get what we should submit today, and planing for our rest homework.
I had difficulties using if and elseif and else function in MATLAB.","I had difficulties using if and elseif and else function in MATLAB.
The instructions for the in class activity were a little confusing at first
I was confused on some of the input commands and how to operate them after typed out.
assignment A08
I was confused on inputting values in the command window. As soon as I realized how easy it was I felt much better."
"i was confused about where to access the class activity.

I thought that the video did a good job of explaining the content. But sometimes he used functions inside of matlab that I was unfamiliar with so it made it more difficult.
Whether while loops can be considered as selection structures or not. Different ways of ending while loops.

"Using selection structures and the input function to create programs. It is interesting because we can make interactive programs now.
The most interesting part always be knowing teammates and working together. It is a lot of fun and I think we can even have classes that we work together the entire time.
I really enjoyed meeting my team today.
i thought it was interesting how you can use the script to find out text displays for different values.
I found the in class activity interesting because of the if statements and how they linked together to get certain results.","I found the ifelse loops the most entertaining and very useful for any future projects I undertake involving decision making.

I found the logical operators the most interesting because they have so many applications

"The information regarding logical operators and using them in combination with the find commanded was not clear.
I found the third part of the in class activity as to what the variables represented.
assignment A06
I was confused on the default layout of matlab. My matlab has separated my script and my command tabs to separate pages and I am confused how to put it back.
I think there should be more about logical list. As how we can use them and how it worked. Also, I think it would be better to talk about some previous homework.","I think I need more practice with making a truth table. I was also struggling to predict the outcomes of logical operators.

I was confused for the components that I need to put for my plots for asssignment 06. I'm was not 100% sure about if I'm following the instructions correctly or not.
The difference between sgtitle and title for making titles for graphs. It can be confusing because some of the commands used are not applicable for both."
"It was confusing partly because I was on zoom so flipping back and forth between my brightpsace and zoom and Matlab is tricky.
The idea of creating multiple figures in one plot was pretty confusing to me. I was also confused about the components that I need to put in my plots.
One thing that I found to be confusing was how to plot multiple datasets in one plot, as I forgot about the hold on and hold off commands.
For our 3A activity, I had difficulty understanding the graph. Whether the Y axis represented the VOC emissions from the production of the Subarus or from the exhaust from the actual cars.
I was a little confused on how fprintf worked especially with the % symbol, but after a while I understood","How to display figures were confusing, specifically how you were to separate the figures so it didn't just display all 3 figures from A06 together on the same graph. The subplot counting was weird how it was the opposite of linear indexing but it was covered well so that worked out in the end.

I think that the array indexing is still confusing. I do not understand how to select values from only a row or a column
