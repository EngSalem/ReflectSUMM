"I think the idea and concepts make sense, but I am confused about what shapes to choose as the Gaussian surface. Can you choose any shape? Are there multiple shapes that will still give the same answer as the cylinder? Also, the conductor vs insulator in reference to Gauss' law is confusing to me
I did not understand why the electric field inside of a solid, uniform, insulating sphere (rR).
The orientation of planar electric fields and cylindrical Gaussian surface
i think the last practice problem we did in class could've been done slower to make it easier to comprehend. i had to think it over for a few minutes after class ended for it to come to me
More examples would be helpful for further understanding.","I did not understand why the electric field inside of a solid, uniform, insulating sphere (r<R) is greater than the field outside of it (r>R).

The second question on the concept quiz confused me, I wasn't sure how positive and negative charges being outside or inside affect flux.
I think the angle at which flux flows from an object is a bit confusing. The first problem on the concept quiz deals with this.
I was confused about why we find the areas of the three different parts of the cylinder, and how we do this."
"i found that the different charge densities were  interesting
Compared to the ring of charge, the line of charge is pretty simple and easy to understand
I love math especially calculus so to see any type is always refreshing. I always enjoy seeing when both are involved in each other (I'm learning some physics in calc 3 right now too)

Collection of point charges (pairing them)","I found equipotentials to be the most interesting thing, especially drawing a equipotentials for a dipole!
How we can calculate something so complicated as electrons passing through an area is very cool.
old concepts being brought back to explain new concepts
The most interesting thing was that finding electric potential doesn't require a path, but only the magnitude of the charge and it's distance from the point of interest.

"I was confused by how to calculate the moment for dipoles that are not in a uniform field.
The math behind why certain numbers can be considered 0 or a simpler version confused me.
Hello I am most confused on these negative and positives, this also includes last chapter as well. I am not quite sure how to identify the directions of both the electric field and the electric force. Also dipole moments was a bit confusing as well.
Could you go over potential energy of a dipole again? Specifically when potential energy is maximum and such?
Sometimes, when Professor Nero is doing practice problems, he writes the steps down really fast, and continues moving on to the next problem. It would be helpful if he slowed a bit after finishing each problem, and allowed time to copy everything down, and absorb the information a little more. This happened for me especially in the suspended water droplet problem.","I found the physical properties of the electric field to be confusing. Like specifically how it relates to electric force.
I was confused by how to calculate the moment for dipoles that are not in a uniform field.

The concept of inertial frames was confusing because I didn't understand why the wrench would appear to be accelerating forward but then i thought about what happens in a car and I got it.
 I was a little confused about the salami question when it was first shown, but the explanation helped."
"nothing was really confusing, the lectures explained the material well
average and instantaneous velocity and acceleration still confuses me

I thought using the kinematic equations on the more difficult questions was challenging. It was sometimes confusing to tell which equation to use.
 I didn't understand the circular motion aspect of today's lecture. I will watch the lectures for Friday but I might need more review Friday.
Also, average and instantaneous velocities and speeds etc. start to blend together after a while and get to be harder to differentiate, especially in terms of what they mean conceptually. 
 The calculus-based content needed more context a graph could've been helpful clearing up any confusion. I also feel like we could've done a few more practice problems about different “topics.”"
"The last top hat question about the one block sitting on top of another one sitting on a frictionless surface
I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how to develop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics.
Friction on an incline was what confused me. When more than one or two forces are applied, I feel like things are bound to get confusing.
Figuring out all the different forces that go with boxes next to each other together
Sometimes finding the force needed to move a block, but this was typically for more complicated problems.","I found the top hat question about the two blocks hanging from the pulley the most confusing just because I understood it when I set the tensions equal to each other but not conceptually 
 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today'slecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how todevelop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics.

Nothing confusing for today
The only thing I was confused about was why density was included in the in class activity.
Not much was confusing about the lecture today. Everything was clearly expressed.
in-class activity","The carbon emissions calculation was a little confusing because I didn't understand where the numbers were coming from at first. The example after the in class activity cleared things up.
I was confused about the in class activity at first but when I discussed it with my group we figured it out. 
There wasn't much confusing work to do the only thing I can think of to be confusing was why we were giving the density of gasoline in our in class activity.

I found the portion of the lecture on assumptions to be a little confusing, as it isn't made too clear the difference between anassumption and data that just isn't reliable."
"Everything was clear and straight forward
I think we should have spent more time on how to create a functional decomposition chart
I think it was a little confusing how biomimicry could be used for this project. There wasn't really any relevant example provided for how we could use it.
I was confused about how to apply bio mimicry to this project.
Something confusing in today's class was the instructions for the new A17 assignment, because we were unsure of what to work on.","I thought that the emphasis on biomimicry was interesting, but I did not understand how it can be applied to our project.

"Group time was very helpful to assign roles for the new project
The most interesting part of today's class was how engineers work effectively with problem scoping to properly define a project.
Design issues as a whole
starting a new project was the most interesting today
starting our own design project","I liked the discussion on the importance of problem scoping and the differences between novice and professional engineers. Particularly asking questions and research.
The breakout room was very fun and informative! We met Jeff Hall today, and he was extremely helpful. We love working in a team and we're excited for the upcoming project. 
What I found most interesting in today's class was how a client or end user was a stakeholder always but a stakeholder could be a client or end user, but is not necessarily always one. 
 The start of a new projects is always interesting I feel that seeing how a project could be integrated so close to me is one of the most exciting things about being an engineer

"There are things that need more explanation of the assignment.
I didn't think anything was confusing for today's class. I thought it all made sense and was very clear. One thing that I think could significantly improve our class is making the class slides available in Brightspace once the class begins. This would be very helpful to the teams, because often what we are working on in the assignment during team class time is related to what was in the slides and what we went over in the class. Having the slides as a reference would be extremely helpful to the teams in using their time most efficiently.
I think that the example for pros and cons could have been better. I don't drink coffee, so I didn't really have much perspective for the problem.
Nothing was super confusing. At first I was worried because A17 is a lot, but once it was clarified that we didn't need to do all of them it made a bit more sense.

 I thought the biomimicry idea generation was difficult to apply in our assignment."
"The overall clarification for the data types was still somewhat confusing. The person who asked about time brought up a good point.
A few answers to questions, particularly about discrete vs continuous and numerical vs categorical data types, were difficult to understand. It wouldv'e been nice to hear another perspective or source about these, maybe a GTA or PT's opinion as well.
The part of class that was confusing was how to find bin width. Or more of once you find it do you need to round it up or to the nearest whole number?
I feel like i have more questions regarding histograms but since I didnt have enough time to tinker with them in excel i couldnt get to ask them. Should I over prepare for classes?
It was a little bit confusing figuring out how to edit the overflow data. Also, this is part of the Modules not the class but I don't understand why the center of a bin is not just the middle number of that bins range (in the module 31 was not the answer for the range 30-32).","The only part of today's class was being able to identify the type of data.
I am still a little bit unclear on how to work some of the aspects on excel including changing the axis value on a Mac.
How to know what data representation method to chose given data.
For A07, I am confused on how we customize the bin widths AND number of bins. 
I feel like the guidance on how we are supposed to complete and do assignments is minimal, and I feel like we the students don't have the ability to reach out for help from the instructor or a TA when we are in our small groups."
"I found it really interesting that one square meter of sunlight is equivalent to approximately 5.8 gallons of gasoline!
It was interesting that we can do something with the solar panel which is considered as future energy

taxonomy was a bit confusing
I found what exactly constitutes folksonomy to be a bit confusing. For example, I know that tags are inherent to the definition as well as a lack of hierarchy, but if we take the hashtag example from class, is there not a sense of hierarchy in terms of preference of the user for the tag. Is there not a hierarchy between the user and the folksonomy or perhaps the interface which presents the info to the user( though perhaps that falls more into the M.L. Realm).
