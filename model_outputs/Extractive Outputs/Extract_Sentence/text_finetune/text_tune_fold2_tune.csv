"i really like learning about the electric charges and i like learning about electrons after taking so many chemistry classes
I found the Part 5: Charges Spread Out video the most interesting! The first one of 50:50 seemed to be expected but I found the grounded conductor and induced charge to be interesting
What I found most interesting today was that there can be two components of an electrostatic force. I found this interesting because  I'm working with forces that are invisible.
The conservation of energy question was very tricky. I was indecisive between the correct answer and the “difference in charge” answer, so I felt that I learned the most from this question.
The amount of interaction we were able to have with you as an instructor and in breakout rooms was interesting.","I thought the demonstration with the lightbulb was fun to watch. It gave me a visual representation of what was happening.
i really like learning about the electric charges and i like learning about electrons after taking so many chemistry classes
Energy conservation in particle physics with a gamma ray photon being split into an electron and positron was very intriguing since I've never learned much about gamma rays in the past.
I found it interesting how similar electric force is to gravitational force.
The amount of interaction we were able to have with you as an instructor and in breakout rooms was interesting."
"Understanding the loop rule and how to do certain calculations with it
I'm confused by the complexity of having multiple loops in circuits. When do you use the loop rule?
I am still confused about the direction of electrons in a magnetic field
Concept quiz 16 question 1 was confusing, why do you add the voltages?
I was confused on how to solve for matrices and determinants using my calculator.","Concept quiz 16 question 1 was confusing, why do you add the voltages?
the differential equation portion involving RC circuits was a little confusing. Another example would be very much helpful for a lot of us I think.
I was a bit confused with the loop rule and multi loop circuits. I had trouble on the concept quiz so I think seeing some more examples being solved would help me.
I was confused about how to use a calculator to solve matrices.
I find the orientation of magnetic fields very confusing. I'm not sure how to tell if it should be pointing in or out of the page, why it is always in the positive or negative k direction, or how it affects which direction a particle will circle in."
"the different types of symmetry
Today's lecture was very interesting. It showed how Gaussian symmetry in different shapes were similar.
The planar electric field being constant
I like the derivation process because you can get answers for any shape.
i thought the top hat questions were interesting because they spiked my thinking.","The planar electric field being constant
Today's lecture was very interesting. It showed how Gaussian symmetry in different shapes were similar.
I think it's interesting how the shell theorem can be used in physics
I found it neat and helpful that drawing a Gaussian surface around or through certain objects with uniform surface charge makes finding E on the object much easier. However knowing how to orient the Gaussian surface seems a bit difficult in some situations.
I thought this concept was easy to grasp. The videos did a great job of helping me picture the scenarios."
"The lost interesting thing is the video demonstrations
I found the balloon tophat question most interesting about today's class because I thought too hard about it at first and once it was explained it was an “ah” moment
I really enjoyed writing the circuit equations in terms of one another and then forming differential equations. On top of already enjoying this unit, I really like this kind of math as well
I found it interesting that magnetic fields are so similar to electric fields.
I think it is interesting how the graphs of charging and discharging a capacitor are able to tell us a lot","It's interesting how the current of an RC circuit is essentially a fraction of the original current dependant on the time constant.
I found the magnetic field lines interesting because no matter how small they get they will always have a north and a south end.

I really enjoyed writing the circuit equations in terms of one another and then forming differential equations. On top of already enjoying this unit, I really like this kind of math as well
I really like that magnetic field lines follow the same rules as electric field lines. I also like that magnetic monopoles haven't been discovered!"
"I enjoyed the Top Hat question about the Right Hand Rule because I was able to practice visualizing the location of the 3-D vector.
The way that the different graphs of velocity, position, and acceleration all relate to one another was incredible interesting.
I really enjoyed the top hat question with the negative cosine angle, causing the dot product to be negative even though it was scalar. I go the question incorrect but I liked how it was explained and I learned a lot from it.
The variety of problems, it gave some range to the material that wasn't in the videos or their example problems.
Velocity and acceleration and their graphs","The right-hand rule was very interesting for me because it is something I've never seen in action before. I was a little confused about it during the reading, but what was talked about in class helped me to get the hang of what it's all about.
I really liked the description of the graphs between acceleration, velocity, and displacement. I've had trouble with them in the past but I feel like I have a good understanding now. 
 I found the live demonstration interesting. It is always useful to see physics happening in real life. It makes all the work seem real and obtainable. We can forget that all this math has real applications.
I really enjoyed the top hat question with the negative cosine angle, causing the dot product to be negative even though it was scalar. I go the question incorrect but I liked how it was explained and Ilearned a lot from it.
I thought the explanations of dot and cross products were interesting because they helped me understand the concepts better."
"Break out rooms were fun and enjoyable
The dinosaurs (Jurassic park vibes), and the intro to group was interesting, because it gave me an idea of how things will work in the future for quizzes and tophat questions.
Velocity of a moving object can vary depending on viewpoint, but acceleration will be the same.
The dinosaur problem was most interesting. I enjoyed that it really challenged you to think about how to set the equations equal to each other and which equation to pick.
I found the conceptual questions that go along with free fall interesting. I like the concept of gravity being constant acceleration.","The dinosaur problem was most interesting. I enjoyed that it really challenged you to think about how to set the equations equal to each other and which equation to pick.
I like projectile motion from my high school physics class so when this video lecture began to talk about gravity and free fall, I really enjoyed it. 
I enjoyed the conceptual top hat questions during this lecture. These connections brought a true understanding of how kinematics work in real life (neglecting air resistance of course).
understanding and getting the majority of the problems asked in tophat correct. this means that i have some sort of a grasp and understand of the topic we're on. 
 found the breakout rooms to be the most interesting. Working as a team is always more productive as I was able to hear different approaches to solving the problem."
"The first problem, particularly finding how the thrower and the kicker relate
Test was kinda hard but not bad, nice to have the ppl to help you
I thought question 2 was confusing because I wasn't sure what to do with the acceleration exactly because block 2 was heavier than block 1.
Exam was tough. fair. VERY tough
The first problem with the football was definitely confusing, but my group mates and I figured it out","There was no video lecture in class as we took the exam. The first problem on the test was a little confusing in the sense that interpreting the time we were supposed to find was difficult. 
I felt like the exam was overall pretty good. This first part was a little more confusing than the second for me, although my group mateshad trouble with the second. 
Questions were very hard compared to study guide. Studied concepts but could not figure out problems.
thought question 2 was confusing because I wasn't sure what to do with the acceleration exactly because block 2 was heavier than block 1.
I guess the test, not sure if my group got it right. Otherwise great experience 7/10 would try again."
"I loved group work and solving problems in pairs
I love the conceptual and find it very easy to understand them, such as the truck and pitching machine. I think visuals really help!
The physics behind the monkey and bullet example, where aiming for the monkey before falling will make the bullet hit it.
The example of the monkey that was falling while there was a gun that shot it. The idea that no matter where you aim as long as you aim at the monkey you will hit it.
I liked the top hat questions. I feel they are engaging and make it easier to learn material.","Definitely the monkey hunting problem. Although I was  confused by thesolution, i was really intrigued by the scenario. It was fascinatingthat the monkey fell right as the golf ball was released, and it madeimpact right before the monkey hit the ground. 
 I thought that relative motion was the most interesting, since it gives you multiple perspectives.
I thought projectile motion was interesting because I learned thatvertical and horizontal motions are independent. Although the xcomponent's velocity is constant, the y component's velocity is not.
 I liked the breakout rooms. It was interesting to hear the points of other students. 
I liked the top hat questions. I feel they are engaging and make it easier to learn material."
"It was interesting to see force applied to real life using friction.
I found interesting how lifting up on something can ease the friction force and allow an object to be moved with less required force because of that.
I found the practice problems on top hat to be most interesting about today's lecture
I love friction problems, as they are simply force diagram problems. Seeing how different objects have different coefficients and why is super cool
I found learning about how friction was really interesting. It was cool to understand how the cold welds between two surfaces impacted friction.","I thought learning about the coefficient of friction and how it's proportional to the normal force was interesting. 
 I found the description of static friction most interesting. I thinkstatic friction is more interesting than kinetic friction because whenstatic friction reaches it's maximum value, any amount of force appliedwill accelerate the object.
Dr. Nero demonstrate how to solve friction problems with 2 body diagrams set up
Learning about the relationship between normal force and friction and how friction works and looks molecularly.
I found learning about how friction was really interesting. It was coolto understand how the cold welds between two surfaces impacted friction."
"I could follow along easily in this lecture. One thing that could've used more explaining was the right hand rule top hat question.
the derivation and explanation of formulas for acceleration and velocity could've been covered and used in examples more
It was unclear how much time we would have in our groups to answer the tophat questions.
The right-hand rule and how to use coordinate plane with just x and z values (as opposed to x and y).
I am a little confused about the last example we were doing, but when I thought over after class, I figured out the answers.","The right hand rule because I was just a bit confused how to read it or tell when it's pointing in or out of the screen.
The position, velocity, and acceleration graphs we touched on at the endof class were a little confusing, specifically the position graph. Weonly talked about it for a little bit at the end of class so I'm surewith more practice I will be able to understand the concept a lotbetter.
How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 the only thing that I would want more details in would be the way an object is 3-D on paper because i still do not get that
Some of the tophat questions lacked directions and made them hard to understand."
"How you can change the system you analyze in the problem depending on what you want to solve for
I found the fact that it became 2T interesting when he pulled himself up.
The different applications of FBD to solve problems like the example of the man supporting himself on the pulley system.
The “recipe” for free body diagrams. It made drawing them a lot easier.
","The “recipe” for free body diagrams. It made drawing them a lot easier.
 Despite this being a difficult concept, i though the man pullinghimself up with a pulley was very interesting, as it shows how pulleyscan be utilized in industry 
Redefining the system to make calculations faster by calling several objects the system instead of just one
I find tension interesting. The fact that two things can way down one rope and it's the same tension fascinated me. 
I found the top hat questions about normal force to be most interesting"
"The terminal velocity question with the difference in air and water density was challenging to see at first.
Centripetal force was confusing and we spent very little time on it
The problem where the person was hitting the water confused me... I thought that because they were entering the water then mg would no longer be acting on them and the only force acting would be drag force
I thought the problem with the skydiver into the ocean was confusing because there were too many variables.
How circular motion works, and how the forces interact.","What was confusing about this lecture was what forces can be considered a centripetal force.  I saw that soletimes it can be the normal force or some other force.
 I think it was tough to conceptualize some of the drag force problems. Although it's not going to be a heavy focus for the exam, I would've liked to connect more drag force problems to conceptual ideas.
 circular motion was barely even taught, especially the net force portion 
the lesson moved really fast for such a complicated topic. deriving the equations was confusing and there weren't enough examples or applications to understand the formulas
I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes. However, your explanation cleared itup. The application of multiple g's tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g."
"I think today's class was executed well and all questions were answered properly and in a timely fashion.
I would like to know what variables and the process of making the graphs that are shown. I think this would make it clearer for us to make good charts in the future.
I was not confused about anything
In today's class nothing was confusing at all! Everything seemed to make a lot of sense!
where to get the data for the project","I would like more details about the A13 to be more clear so it's easier to accomplish.
The in-person activity wasn't clear on what needed to be done.
unfortunately we received our grade back for assignment A12 and we were somewhat co fused on how we did not get a higher grade.
 Also, I was confused about finding the constraints for this project.
 I think it would be helpful going a little more over the calculations for energy. I just need help deciding what units to put my calculations in."
"I was a little confused as to what the next assignment due for class is. I got it figured out with one of the TAs help. I'm also still confused as to why we didn't get a solution key for the practice exam to study.
I did not find anything confusing or in need of more details during today's class.

"I found the video very interesting because it stressed how important it is for engineers to do many trials on products before releasing them.
I liked meeting up with my teammates and talking about when we should meet up with each other.
It was interesting how excel could be used in a variety of ways to make sense out of the bike share data.
Meeting my engineering group was definitely the best part of class!
The discussion about mean,median, and mode.","The youtube video was interesting regarding why diversity is useful when creating new products
I think the Excel stuff is pretty interesting.
 I found it very interesting that all of my group members are on campus. We can all meet in person and don't have to worry about different time zones.
I think the filters and pivot tables and pivot charts seem very useful.
The diversity announcement was very intriguing. I liked how it was incorporated and how we touched upon how it relates directly to engineers."
"I found the information about modeling, the different kinds of modeling, and laminar modeling interesting.
The relationship between finding different types of representations for the surface area and volume of the taum sauk reservoir was interesting to me.
It was interesting that we learned a variety of different topics.
I liked learning more about the Taum Sauk Reservoir and how it works today
The in class activity was very interesting","I thought that the mathematical modeling with perimeters Of shapes was interesting and fun 
I found that spending more time with our break out groups was helpful for working through any confusion
Finding the volume for the reservoir was interesting because we are applying our math knowledge to a real life situation
It was fun and interesting using google earth to map the surface area of the reservoir.
The time to work on A10 was helpful"
"nothing
I found it interesting how there are so many softwares available to make pro types on!
The most interest part of today's class was learning about the different ways to prototype our solutions.
I liked how much time we got to work on our new assignment.
The time to work with our teams in break out rooms","This is a long project, so I like how we're looking back on what we'vedone so far. This may give us a better understanding of how we'll moveforward.
I found all of the different ways to prototype fairly interesting and how many possible sources of evidence there are.
 I found interesting how we have a 3D printing club where we couldusetheir resources for our project. Also the amounts of availablesoftwareprograms offered by Purdue.
The time to work with our teams in break out rooms
I liked Jeff's Robin costume."
"The sharing of engineering failures that we know was interesting.
Talking about engineering failures and bringing up how these are important for us to know and to be able to learn from them makes it interesting.
nothing.
I found the conversation on preventable mistakes very important because these mistakes affect people's lives or, in extreme cases, take them.
I learned about different things from today's class about different incidents which I never thought before","I liked seeing the different examples of engineering gone wrong
 mathematical modeling is still really interesting problem solving. 
The time spent in breakout rooms with my team are super helpful. We areable to get through a lot of project material in the given time.
Working with the power formula
I found it interesting that engineers careless mistakes caused the Taum Sauk failure."
"I was confused about entering the complex calculations into excel. I haven't used excel in a long time so I think I just need practice.
Nothing
I was a little confused on how to properly fill out Assignment 03 as it was not discussed. I was still also confused by the end of class what exactly was due when.
Excel stuff was confusing and the problem statement
Some of the instructions for the in class activities were a little unclear.","I was confused about entering the complex calculations into excel. I haven't used excel in a long time so I think I just need practice. 
 The problem statement outline was not very helpful and the problem we were asked to find seem very vague. 
How to access the excel file.

 The only thing I found confusing today was the formula input for the gravitational forces calculation"
"The in class assignment was very confusing, I had no idea what to submit into bright space. The presentation slides weren't put on bright space either. The instructions for what we were supposed to do once in our team groups should be more specific.
Pivot tables were sort of rushed through and their uses weren't fully explained which left my breakout group confused on what to do.
Very little. I would have likes more time spent in the groups, but I assume that we'll get more of that further into the project.
I didn't find anything confusing in class. I understood the concepts and my group worked well together to accomplish our tasks. The break out sessions were also a good amount of time.
The amount of time spent during class explaining the different data types could use some lengthening.","If you could put the slides on brightspace before the video call itwould be helpful, because then we could have it open and look at them ifwe get lost during a call
I was confused on what the task is for assignment 5 and how we need to use the bike share data to complete the assignment.
I think it was a little confusing for some people when doing theexcelassignment since some people are still getting used to it and youwent alittle fast. 
The instructions for the descriptive statistics activity weren't very clear and I wasn't sure how to present what I found.

"I thought the quiz was interesting
I enjoyed brainstorming with my team because it was informative and helpful to get our ideas down on paper.
I found interesting how we use nature to come up with ideas.
I liked how we did the quiz in class rather than outside of class because I have a lot of other assignments to do for my other classes.
Designing solutions was fun.","I liked how we did the quiz in class rather than outside of classbecause I have a lot of other assignments to do for my other classes.
I found the multiple types of inspiration on idea generation to be the most interesting part of today's class.
I found it interesting how our group has to take pictures of our think process and use it for the end product.
I found the ironclad beetle biomimicry segment to be most interesting as I love getting ideas from nature.
the beetle video was really cool"
"I really enjoyed today's class!!
Nothing was confusing
How to take exam
I didn't find anything confusing in class today.
Nothing seemed to be confusing at all in today's class!","I found that during the studio time, I was confused as to whether use a constant pressure head or using a changing one that changes based on the height of the upper reservoir.
 We could have used some more information about how to prepare for the exam. In other classes I know there are previous exams that we can use to study.
This class was not confusing, but you could have gone over expectations for A12 some more
How the excel will work for the in class quiz
 Basically everything made sense today, i never really had any questions but the ones i did were answered when we went into breakout rooms. It would have been nice if we could have done some review on the quiz"

The most confusing part was when different assignments are due
 the consistency between the powerpoints and the doc is bad sometimes"
"I was confused on what kind of reaserch would be required outside of the information given to us in the assignment document.
I was happy with today's class. No technological issues and extremely productive. The extended time in breakout rooms was very helpful as well in getting a great head start with A013.
I found nothing to be confusing or unclear in today's class. Everything was explained well and made clear prior to the given work time. Making sure to explain what was needed and expected for the project helped me gain a better understanding before going into it.
One thing that was confusing about today's class was are you able to use more than 500 solar panels for the library? Or are we just solely supposed to perform calculations based on the idea that we are using 500 solar panels?
I feel like today's class could've used a more in depth explanation of how power is produced, we discussed methods of producing power but not actually how the power was produced.","I feel like today's class could've used a more in depth explanation of how power is produced, we discussed methods of producing power but not actually how the power was produced.
 I was confused on A13 even after reading the instruction on part 4, it included calculations that I didn't understand where we could get the information from.
 thought it was confusing when we were trying to figure out what exact calculations we needed to do to do an environmental and economic evaluation 
There's no excel file and the memo is rough with info.
 I would have liked some more information on the emissions of Solar Panels and the systems currently used in powering the Indianapolis Library."
"Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing. I would've liked a bit more information about it, and how it works.
The due dates are alittle confusing in bright space so maybe a better expiration on how to find things better
the assignment number 5
What we were supposed to be doing in the first breakout room was confusing because we were just sitting around for most of it and we didn't know what to do.
","I have already done a good amount of assignment A08 and it's a bit confusing about what is my x, mean, and standard deviations have to use
 Something I found unclear about today's lecture was how the z number was used in the calculus equation for area under the curve.
I found some of the instructions for the histogram rule of thumb confusing, as I couldn't figure out to what extent we need to abide by it (do we always need to have exactly the square root of the count in bins?)
Discussing the calculus formula for finding the area was a bit confusing.
I didn't find anything too particularly confusing, however, during the skittles assignment my group struggled to understand what the objective was, so I had to explain it myself for a while"
"I was confused as to why the assignment 10 submission didn't work at first for our group, but that's no longer an issue since it was reopened.
I want to know more about volumetric flow rate and assignment 12 but it wasn't that confusing
Personally, I did not have any issues with the material in class today. There was not much new information and mostly group work.

Something that was confusing was details regarding the A10 assignment, but at the end those issues were resolved.","The turning in of assignment a10, but this was resolved by the end of class well enough
Assignment A12 was introduced during class today, and I found it a little confusing what was expected of us for the assignment.

How to calculate the power generator 
 Finding the instantaneous flow rate is somewhat confusing on excel."
"I felt like everything was pretty clear today, but I was a bit confused on what VIIIa) was asking at first on A12.
I thought that the research was the most difficult since it required me to evaluate sources based on their merit.
I found the lecture very clear today. Everything made sense because it was explained thoroughly and completely. I know what I am going to do to study for the exam and I am on track with my team for A12.
The majority, if not all the information today was clear to me.

I still struggle with determining volumetric flow rate."
"I was somewhat confused by some of the problems in assignment 10, but I worked through it with my group by the end of the class. For example, we were struggling to get the slope demonstrated in the slides.
I thought that the most difficult aspect of today's class was graphing regression, although it was not difficult. Class was supposed simple today.
I am still slightly confused on the purpose of finding the overall slope of the data. I know this can help find trends but am confused how this will help with scattered data. Overall, I get the process of it but found the purpose of it confusing.
The linear regression slides were very confusing to me however after doing the excel activity it is straightforward and i understand the concepts taught
I was not confused today.","Simple linear regression needed more details, especially as it relates to what the r squared value does.
Assignment 11 needed more explanation. Specifically, I struggled with the wording of particular questions. If the problems were more descriptive I would have understood the questions much easier.
Proper was to calculate the surface area to find volume
We could have gone over the laminar approach more because the regression line information seemed pretty easy to understand based on the module videos.
What will be covered in Exam 1"
"Today's class was little confusing and I didn't need any extra details.
Prototyping
The confusing part about today was figuring out how my group will make the prototypes and test them in life. This was confusing for us because one of our team members is off campus, so we need to figure out how to test the prototypes and how we are making them.
Nothing was confusing in today's class
What was confusing was how the prototypes the groups create will be tested. My group was having a hard time understanding how this would be done virtually and with models of our design (given we don't have the ability to make real models of our prototype with the materials we wanted)","We as a team found it difficult to find out not only how we would build a prototype, and how to test it. Unless we make them individually, physical prototypes aren't really feasible due to ourseparation.
How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment.
I am unsure of when A18 is due because bright space still has it down for next Friday. But it was said that we will work on it next Friday in class as well.
Thinking of prototypes while most of our ideas had to do with the road was confusing"
"I think we should have spent more time on how to create a functional decomposition chart
I was confused about how to apply bio mimicry to this project.
I thought that the emphasis on biomimicry was interesting, but I did not understand how it can be applied to our project. We are dealing with roads and traffic, so there is little I can see that the natural world can offer.
The biotechnology was a little confusing and could be explained a little more in the context of a17.

It was interesting to consider the many kinds of resource usage (time, space, bandwidth, etc.). The tent talk was also interesting!
The most interesting part of this lecture was discussing the different methods of comparing algorithm performance. I have learned about this in past courses, but I felt the discussion in class was very comprehensive and well-explained.

One thing that was a little confusing was the typing of certain symbols and formulas into Excel. For example, it was difficult for me to remember how to lock certain numbers as absolute values. Once I refreshed my memory I was able to get it because I did have experience with it while watching the pre-class videos, but it was a lot for me to remember. Also, I never figured out how to type the symbol for degrees with my keyboard into Excel. It was not a big deal, but I am guessing that learning that information will save me some time and energy in the future.

"I found that it was interesting that the computer ran faster using arrays I stead of for loops
It was hard to find anything interesting in class other than the in class activity. It basically timed suppressed and unsuppressed loops. We found that suppressed loops run quicker than unsuppressed loops
I found it interesting of how much faster the calculations took between for loops and vector operations.
nested loops to solve the problem
Nested loops","I liked seeing the iterations done out so I could think about what the for and while loops were actually accomplishing.
I thought the tic-Toc function was interesting. I thought it was interesting because I did now know that there was a function that displayed the time it takes to function the function and display the answers.
I was intrigued by the speed difference that suppressing code makes. It's cool to see computing time actually being visualized.
I found it interesting how the vector form is faster than the for loop and how the suppressed code is faster than the unsuppressed code.
I found the in class activity the most interesting in todays class. I could genuinely tell that the activity was there for me to get better at complex loops. I also found it interesting how this was one of the harder lessons so far this semester yet it was the shortest lecture."
"The most confusing thing was the first problem of A11. I was confused on how the no loop would work efficiently
Was a bit confused on suppressed vs unsuppressed calculations but understood it after further investigation with the in class activity
The operations performed in the for and while loop examples on the board were a bit confusing because the computation kept getting messed up, but it was okay.
Suppressing code
I found the nested loops a bit confusing.","Todays class was about complex loops. It was really hard for me to see the point in them. We basically eliminate loops that are designed to make our jobs easier such as for loops and while loops, and use other methods to get the same answer.
The operations performed in the for and while loop examples on the board were a bit confusing because the computation kept getting messed up, but it was okay.
I was confused that there is a way to do a for loop and a while loop in a nested structure. It was hard to learn how to use these as a vector.
The most confusing thing was the first problem of A11. I was confused on how the no loop would work efficiently
What was confusing was the difference between suppressed and unsuppressed code because this made the in class activity very difficult to get started."

"I could use some more explanation on how to save matlab files. Although we do not need to save the files to submit the assignment, I would like to be able to save the files for future reference or in case I have a problem with submission. Also, some more review on inputing long equations would be helpful.
I couldn't keep up with the pace of the class because the teacher spoke a little fast today. I hope some key teachers can speak in a slow pace.Everything else is perfect and his/her help is timely.
The due dates for some items are confusing because of how many things are going on. However I had some concerns lifted today after asking the teaching team. The lecture was very good otherwise.
I did not realize that you can go back on to the same question when you clear your workspace. How long do you have to edit or resubmit your answers until you get a different variation of the question? Everything else was fine!
I had a hard time figuring out where to access the Matlab files because they are stored in a different drive than where I keep the test of my schoolwork and related information.","I could use some more explanation on how to save matlab files.

"It was a little difficult to remember the difference between SSE and SST because they are similar
Nothing was confusing today
I was not confident on how to plot the dataset and the model during the In-class activity.
The instructions for the ICA activity needed clarification
I think that the goodness of fit could use some more details. It seems to me that linear regression is typically more accurate than goodness of fit, so I am confused on why it is important to use.","I felt very confident today, nothing confusing

Learned a lot of new functions that will be useful in the future.
I found most interesting all of the different built in functions that MatLab has.
I found the loading of the .p file using A00_skills using the PUID and problem number to get the information we need for the assignment.","I found learning about generating unique problems in Matlab insteresting.
I thought it was very interesting that MATLAB can solve equations completely differently depending on the order and organization of the numbers that are typed in.
I thought all the different ways to write matrices or arrays was quite interesting.
I enjoyed the assignment portion of the class, especially how well the assignment file integrated into MATLAB. For example, the second part of the assignment where the equation popped up as an image was very cool.
The most interesting was doing the assignment 00. Even though the assignment was decently simple, I enjoyed putting commands into MATLAB and getting an output."
"I enjoyed learning how to build up a matrix in detail. I also found interesting is that how I  am able to edit a matrix based on commands in MatLab.
I was interested in how to manipulate vectors in matlab and find unique solutions to problems asked in the assignment
The most interesting thing in class was that you can array index entire columns and entire rows. I thought it was interesting because it will be a helpful tool to use in the future when there are large amounts of data or if a mistake was made with the data.
Using different methods to reference an index in a matrix was interesting.
It was interesting to utilize the knowledge we have learned to apply it to A05","I was very intrigued about matrices and that using matrixA (ones) you could produce a matrix with all ones and the easily use your code to test whether you could replace the right value or not. I learned that MatLab returns a single value when an input of a function was a vector which is something I never knew about.
In todays class, the most interesting thing I found was unzipping a file in order to work on it on MATLAB.

"Nothing, everything made sense
The process for finding and submitting assignments was slightly confusing.
How to save folders in MATLAB.
What assignments are due when
The steps needed to run a .p file in MATLAB were confusing at first, but were clarified later on. Other than that the lecture was easy to understand.","I was a little confused on how to find the .p files, download them, and then run them in MATLAB. However, by the end of class I felt like I knew how to do it reasonably well.
I believe one piece of information the professor could have gone more in depth about is maybe showed us how to open the p file instead of going in depth on the arrays and everything. I think most students understood the matrixes and arrays very well, but the p file and saving that and creating a math lab function was confusing for first time programming users like me.
What matrices and arrays actually are- know how they look in matlab but are they just a way to set up data for calculations?
The process for finding and submitting assignments was slightly confusing.
Something that I need a little more information about is how to get extra credit. I was still a little confused."

I found learning to plot in MATLAB confusing because there is a lot of information to learn all at once.
Plotting models
The homework was not correctly formatted so there was some confusion over what objectives had to be met. The questions were not numbered in MatLab as they were in the PDF.
The fprintf function, all of the examples helped but an in class activity utilizing the function would be very helpful for understanding how to use it. The examples during the lecture had me feeling the same way I felt after the pre class videos; slightly confused"

"the z value things were pretty weird. it would have been nice to go slower on that stuff.
A bit confusing, but I blame that on my inattentiveness at certain points, and the feeling of overwhelming data. Thanks for breaking the histograms down, but I could use a little more clarification on Z-scores. Specifically, what should one do to fix a histogram to a normal look to get correct z scores? Also, how far can a graph go from being just slightly different than normal?
