N/A (it was interesting in a way once you got past the panic)","The first problem on the test was interesting as it was a real life situation most have taken a part in.
The names of the football players were very interesting 
Same as before
The second question about the blocks was actually fun, I had done several like it while studying
There was no video to find anything interesting. The problems were interesting though
I enjoyed group tests simply because people can guide my ideas and help me get the answer. 
There were only two test questions but they both took a lot of time. 
Question 2 I thought it was interesting as it felt similar to a homework problem we had

I definitely needed to brush up on it though because we had off from school for so long. That's how I feel about most of my classes though. -> 1
I found conceptualizing relative forces a bit confusing but the computation was easy -> 1
nothing -> 1
N/A -> 1
I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2 -> 3
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it. -> 4
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors. -> 3
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition -> 2
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to. -> 3
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios. -> 3
I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity. -> 3
The top hat question about relative motion -> 2
1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday -> 4
Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation -> 1
For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again. -> 4
Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example. -> 1
Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not. -> 1
I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. -> 4
The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance. -> 1
The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully. -> 3
Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense. -> 1
I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. -> 2
I thought today's lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion. -> 1
I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity -> 1
The question that could've used more explaining was the top hat question about relative motion -> 1
Relative motion was the most confusing topic. It's just hard to wrap your head around the concept sometimes. -> 2
I found relative motion somewhat confusing. Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing. -> 2
I think that more explanation on relative motion with multiple velocities would be helpful -> 3
I found the relative motion questions really confusing before class examples, and while I still am not exactly sure about them, todays lecture cleared it up a little bit. I think that the monkey example could have used a little more explaining. -> 2
The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing. -> 2
Relative motion from a moving reference point -> 3
Today's lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept -> 3
I don't quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it?? -> 2
I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. -> 2
need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems -> 2
There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don't have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn't included. -> 1
I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it. -> 1
more relative motion problems -> 3

Relative motion was confusing, especially the question on the concept quiz with the ball and the pitching machine and the truck. -> 3
Tension forces -> 2
I think the practice problem could have been explained in a bit more detail, it was a bit confusing and I wish there was some more explanation -> 3
how to order vectors when adding them with relative motion. -> 2
Some of the properties and subscripts of 1-D relative motion mainly because it was a little difficult to keep track of everything. -> 2
Relative Motion! I'm aware that it's mainly vector addition / subtraction, but I get confused on the values and the order to add / subtract. -> 3","Nothing was confusing today.

 more relative motion problems 
 I have no questions.
 relative motion in 2d
 I was slightly confused about the Bonnie and Clyde roller blading question, but when the TA came into our breakout room he was helpful and the explanation afterwards was helpful too. 
 Relative motion from one point of view. Determining velocities from different perspectives 
 The arrangement of subscripts/variables used in Relative Motion equations was a bit confusing to me 
 I'm still not 100% sure how relative motion works when given vector components. 
 I am still confused about relative motion in 1-D. My main question is how do you apply vector addition to two different reference frames.
 The reference frames are still a little confusing to me, since I'm not sure how to assign a frame to each object.
 relative motion in 2-d
 The 2-D relative motion confused me. I think another example would have helped
 Relative motion is still somewhat difficult for me to picture, especially when things go in opposite directions
 I am still confused about when to add or subtract vectors in relative motion. 
 relative motion and the reasoning for subtracting vectors instead of adding
 You could have discussed the matter of changing what direction is positive or negative. 
 I need to work on using the correct kinematics equation. The concept of relative motion is confusing, because I can't understand reference views.
 Relative motion was confusing, especially the question on the concept quiz with the ball and the pitching machine and the truck.
 Tension forces 
 I think the practice problem could have been explained in a bit more detail, it was a bit confusing and I wish there was some more explanation
 how to order vectors when adding them with relative motion.
 Some of the properties and subscripts of 1-D relative motion mainly because it was a little difficult to keep track of everything.
 Relative Motion! I'm aware that it's mainly vector addition / subtraction, but I get confused on the values and the order to add / subtract.","The vast majority of students had difficulty with relative motion.

Many students specifically stated the monkey problem as the one they had the most difficulty with.

I was slightly confused about the Bonnie and Clyde roller blading question, but when the TA came into our breakout room he was helpful and the explanation afterwards was helpful too.
Relative motion from one point of view. Determining velocities from different perspectives
The arrangement of subscripts/variables used in Relative Motion equations was a bit confusing to me
I’m still not 100% sure how relative motion works when given vector components.
I am still confused about relative motion in 1-D. My main question is how do you apply vector addition to two different reference frames.
The reference frames are still a little confusing to me, since I’m not sure how to assign a frame to each object.
relative motion in 2-d
The 2-D relative motion confused me. I think another example would have helped
Relative motion is still somewhat difficult for me to picture, especially when things go in opposite directions
I am still confused about when to add or subtract vectors in relative motion.
relative motion and the reasoning for subtracting vectors instead of adding
You could have discussed the matter of changing what direction is positive or negative.
I need to work on using the correct kinematics equation. The concept of relative motion is confusing, because I can’t understand reference views.
Relative motion was confusing, especially the question on the concept quiz with the ball and the pitching machine and the truck.
Tension forces
I think the practice problem could have been explained in a bit more detail, it was a bit confusing and I wish there was some more explanation
how to order vectors when adding them with relative motion.
Some of the properties and subscripts of 1-D relative motion mainly because it was a little difficult to keep track of everything.
Relative Motion! I’m aware that it’s mainly vector addition / subtraction, but I get confused on the values and the order to add / subtract.","Nothing was confusing today. It was all intro physics that I have learned my senior year. I definitely needed to brush up on it though because we had off from school for so long. That’s how I feel about most of my classes though.
I found conceptualizing relative forces a bit confusing but the computation was easy
nothing
N/A
I didn't understand how the initial monkey equations was set at -(Y-changein Yb)= 0 - 1/2gt^2
the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
I thought that relative motion was really confusing. This is because I was having trouble understanding when to add the vectors and when to subtract the vectors.
relative motion was a bit tricky-like when to use vector subtraction/addition
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
I would like to work more with the kinematic equations, explaining when and how to use them in different scenarios.
 I have difficulty conceptualizing relative speed, specifically when something is launched off of something with a horizontal initial velocity.
 The top hat question about relative motion
 1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday 
 Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
 For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.
 Nothing specific, I feel Dr. Nero explained everything thoroughly. It makes more sense to me of the relative motion after each example.
 Nothing was really confusing in this lesson. Maybe the only thing that was confusing was the vector question with the two people and one was going at an angle and the other was not.
 I did not understand the monkey example problem and still struggle with relative motion. 
 The example with the bullet being fired straight up out of a car driving with constant velocity. In the example the air resistance was neglected what would the outcome be if there were air resistance.
 The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn’t understand this setup fully.
 Nothing was confusing during this lecture. Everything made sense with the videos that we watched outside of class. Both relative motion and projectile motion made sense.
 I felt as though the problems went a little too quickly. It was hard to respond in time but I understand that we have to keep moving along to get to all the problems we need. 
 I thought today’s lecture videos could have gone into more depth about relative motion.
 I did not find anything confusing today. I actually fully understood the lecture. If there was anything confusing it was the last concept question because I have a difficult time determining the velocity 
 The question that could’ve used more explaining was the top hat question about relative motion
 Relative motion was the most confusing topic. It’s just hard to wrap your head around the concept sometimes. 
 I found relative motion somewhat confusing. Determining direction relative to different perspectives was confusing.
 I think that more explanation on relative motion with multiple velocities would be helpful 
 I found the relative motion questions really confusing before class examples, and while I still am not exactly sure about them, todays lecture cleared it up a little bit. I think that the monkey example could have used a little more explaining. 
 The monkey and the hunter problem was confusing. Conceptually it made sense, but the numbers and vectors were confusing.
 Relative motion from a moving reference point
 Today’s lecture was good. I thought the final step in explaining the monkey experiment was a bit confusing, when you described how to use tangent to come to the conclusion. The tophat questions were good theoretical questions that gave us a good understanding of the concept
 I don’t quite understand how does the Monkey and the bullet example work. What is the equation used/ how to calculate it??
 I was a little confused on the last question we did today but I understood it after went over it. I got stuck on simplifying the two projectile equations though. 
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
 There was really nothing I need more details on. I think today was a great lecture I don’t have any questions about the material. However I think the monkey problem needed to specify that the projectile was launched at an angle, if that wasn’t included.
 I understood every thing that was taught during the lecture today. I was confused on the vectors of the cars speed at first but I know understand it.
 more relative motion problems 
 I have no questions.

I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out -> 2
Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right? -> 1

When given a word problem like the one example of the players hitting the puck how can you easily get an idea of what direction the vector would be going in -> 2
I thought the first top hat question was difficult and I still think my answer could have been correct.  How could you know from the information in the question the the two vectors were headed in the same direction? -> 3
Sometimes I felt like issues with TopHat (not always my own) took away from the explanation of answers, but these are just temporary as we all get used to the format. -> 1
Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas. -> 2

Today's video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down! -> 2
Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. -> 2

There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture. -> 1
The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. -> 3
I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. -> 1
Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. -> 1
The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks. -> 1
How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail. -> 3
I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? -> 1
Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist. -> 1
I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. -> 1
I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? -> 1
It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful. -> 2
I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. -> 2
Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. -> 2
The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though. -> 1
Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. -> 1
I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz. -> 3
A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method. -> 2
Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. -> 3
I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. -> 3
I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great! -> 2
In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract. -> 3
Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. -> 2
Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. -> 1
everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing -> 1
I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing. -> 2
In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.) -> 1
The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you! -> 3
Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. -> 3
The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1. -> 2
The video lectures were thorough about how to do the math for vectors. The thing that is confusing was the identification of scalars and vectors specifically if scalars need units or not. -> 2","Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable) -> 4

Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist. -> 3
I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. -> 3
I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? -> 4
It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful. -> 4
I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. -> 3
Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. -> 4

A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method. -> 3
Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. -> 4
I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. -> 4
I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great! -> 3
In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB.

In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.) -> 4
The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you! -> 4
Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. -> 4
The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1. -> 3

Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today's lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today's lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that's just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today's lecture was good. One thing I'd like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn't already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don't understand when we subtract and don't add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn't quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn't as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today's lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today's video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven't used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you'll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn't be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.
 The video lectures were thorough about how to do the math for vectors. The thing that is confusing was the identification of scalars and vectors specifically if scalars need units or not.","Many students still have some questions about vector mathematics. It seems like they still need some practice with it. Some students are also having some issues with TopHat. Again, this might be due to them needing more practice.

I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. -> 1
Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that’s just cause I prefer it that way. -> 1
The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks. -> 1
How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail. -> 3
I thought today’s lecture was good. One thing I’d like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn’t already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? -> 4
Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist. -> 3
I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. -> 3
I just don’t understand when we subtract and don’t add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? -> 4
It seemed like some people didn’t quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful. -> 4
I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. -> 3
Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn’t always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I’ll get at it. -> 4
The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn’t as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though. -> 1
Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. -> 4
I followed along very well in today’s lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz. -> 3
A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method. -> 3
Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. -> 4
I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. -> 4
I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great! -> 3
In today’s video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract. -> 4
Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. -> 3
Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven’t used them too much in about a year. -> 3
everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing -> 1
I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing. -> 3
In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you’ll lose points for each attempt.) -> 4
The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn’t be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you! -> 4
Something that was confusing about today’s video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I’m not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. -> 4
The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1. -> 3
The video lectures were thorough about how to do the math for vectors. The thing that is confusing was the identification of scalars and vectors specifically if scalars need units or not. -> 4","Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable) -> 4.0

Today’s lecture was clear and for the most part easy to follow. The only part that I still am confused on is using unit vectors. However, I believe this will be covered in more detail with the next lecture. -> 1.0
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn’t work, and I needed to subtract 360°. -> 4.0
I think it would be more beneficial if you would go in depth of your pictures drawn and explain how they apply to a numerical problem even more. -> 4.0
I didn’t find anything confusing or unclear during today’s class. I have already taken 2 years of physics, so I know this content very well and is something I’m very comfortable with. I believe the way you taught it is very similar to how I first learned the material. -> 2.0
One thing I will definitely need to be looking more in to is the subtraction of vectors from the Yeti problem, when solving on my own i had a slightly different answer, so I will be trying to figure out why. -> 4.0
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could’ve been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong. -> 4.0
I believe that what is most confusing to me about the lecture is when to use sin and cos for x and y, and occasionally where to put the angle given. I think i confuse myself when it comes to sin and cos. -> 4.0
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out -> 4.0
Nothing extremely confusing this time around. Just to make sure, whenever you need to find the vector from one tip of a vector to another one, when both are going in a different direction from the origin, you have to subtract, right? -> 4.0

There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.) -> 4.0
Today’s video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself.

Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas.

 Most of the material covered today is content I have seen before so it was not confusing at all. The clicker questions were explained clearly. They only thing that is sometimes confusing is navigating canvas.
 didn't have much trouble with any of the concepts presented in the lecture today. I have taken physics so this was a pretty basic review
 There honestly wasn't anything that was notably confusing or lacking in detail. (We're also working on vector basics in Calc 3 though, so it's possible that there was simply a lot of fortuitous overlap.)
 Today’s video was good. I was confused throughout the video on how to know whether or not to subtract or add vectors based on the specific question, but I believe that is more so me understanding the problem and how to properly draw out the graph and vectors and understanding what the question is asking us to do than the actual math itself. Therefore I believe that with additional lectures and practice I will have it down!
 Most everything was described clearly, including teaching style, content, and Canvas. For me personally, I still had questions by the end of the lecture about what/how to use Piazza, TopHat, and Sapling. Luckily, everything was figured out by our second meeting through your clarification and other students help. 
 How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
 This was the first class with introductions and an overview of the course. I think my professor did a great job of explaining the course criteria and the websites we will be using throughout the semester.
 The only thing I found confusing in today’s lecture was the second top hat question we did. I was confused about how to determine whether we would add the vectors or subtract them. 
 There was nothing confusing to me in today’s lecture.
 The first multiple choice question confused me today. I was not sure how to do it or where to start but after the explanation I understand why the answer was B. 
 I was a little confused about the way tophat worked at the beginning of the lecture and how much time we would have for each part but after I used it for the first question I got the hang of it. 
 Everything was explained very well and in detail. I used law of sines and cosines for some problems but that’s just cause I prefer it that way. 
 The only new thing to me was the idea of subtracting vectors. For example the top hat question was asking if you would add or subtract/which way you would subtract. However, with examples I was able to understand. I did like the breakout groups and getting to discuss with classmates. I also wish that the comment section was geared more towards questions and not comments because questions can get lost. Thanks.
 How, even with having to visualizing a resultant vector, the two addition vectors do not need to be visualized tip to tail.
 I thought today’s lecture was good. One thing I’d like clarification on is vector notation if it hasn’t already been specified in the question. Will you expect a specific notion? Will you expect the (i, j, k) notation or is arrow(<x,y>) acceptable too? 
 Our first lecture was not co fusing. We talked about the syllabus, how grading works, how extra credit is assigned, and what programs to install. The only confusing part is making sure we have all the software and books we need. Something that could help with that is a checklist.
 I had a bit of trouble interacting with others in the breakout rooms, but that is something I will work on improving myself. 
 I just don’t understand when we subtract and don’t add. I understand why we have to subtract certain ways but when do we subtract? 
 It seemed like some people didn’t quite know how Tophat was going to work, and missed out on partial question points by not submitting an answer. Maybe another quick recap of the program and grading policies before starting the first question would be useful.
 I am still having some difficulties adding and subtracting vectors geometrically which also goes along with making the vector drawings for word problems. 
 Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn’t always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I’ll get at it. 
 The video was good today, and the worked out examples helped. I personally wasn’t as prepared as I needed to be for class because this is my first flipped class ever. I look foreword to improving this for next class though.
 Maybe some clarification on when it is necessary to add 180 degrees to the answer of some problems and specifically how to identify when to do that both before you answer the problem and after. 
 I followed along very well in today’s lecture, but I wish I had a bit more practice before answering the TOPHAT questions. I watched/did the extra problems and videos in addition to the quiz.
 A thing that confused me this lecture was how to subtract vectors. Now when I say this I am talking about the beginning of class, by the end of class I was beginning to understand through techniques like the trace method.
 Need more description about how you know what directions you draw vectors in all different cases, especially when you are trying to find the expression for a resultant using the subtraction of two other vectors. When drawing the resultant, do you always start from the first vector you drew and connect it to the last? I am very confused and others in my breakout room were too. 
 I am slightly confused about Unit Vectors. It would have been nice to have a bit more context or explanation about this topic. 
 I think it was a pretty good class, vector subtraction was a bit confusing but I think the explanation on adding vectors was great!
 In today’s video lecture I struggled with figuring out when to subtract and when to add vectors. For example, in the yeti problem I did not know if you were supposed to add the two vectors or subtract them. The same goes for the Top Hat question earlier. in class regarding RA and RB. My instinct is to always add it it confuses me on when to subtract.
 Nothing from this video lecture was particularly unclear. It would be helpful to have more problems where unit vectors are used and/or examples of their overall use in physics. 
 Just needed back in the swing of all the trig functions. Haven’t used them too much in about a year. 
 everything made sense, I didn't find anything confusing
 I have difficulty figuring out which direction (as in North of East or South of West) the resulting vector is pointing.
 In the Vector Basics section maybe include a position vs. time graph problem with questions related to trying to find speed and velocity in order to really highlight the difference between scalars and vectors in the scope of this class. Additionally the Adding and Subtracting Vectors by Components could use another example on how to arrange the arrows to suit a given equation when they are all out of order. (Side note: on the concept quizzes, I feel like there should be a note that you only have one opportunity to get full points, following that you’ll lose points for each attempt.)
 The information was explained in an easy to understand manner. However, I would like more information on negative vectors and how they affect the problem when the resultant gets moved around. I know you said that negative vectors wouldn’t be used much but I still think it was a confusing topic. Thank you!
 Something that was confusing about today’s video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I’m not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees. 
 The lecture was overall very clear. The only part I found slightly confusing was the unit vectors, specially the purpose they serve, since it is just multiplying by 1.
 The video lectures were thorough about how to do the math for vectors. The thing that is confusing was the identification of scalars and vectors specifically if scalars need units or not.","Many students still have some questions about vector mathematics. It seems like they still need some practice with it. Some students are also having some issues with TopHat. Again, this might be due to them needing more practice. Some other issues that the students have involve using sin and cos, angles, and the right-hand rule.","How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value.

I was confused about how to calculate the amount of CO2 emissions in grams per mile because the brightspace PowerPoint slides were confusing. -> 3
I think a clarification on how to calculate CO2 emissions would be helpful to the class. Other than that the class was executed well. -> 2
The most confusing part of today's class was when the data from the bright space slide was different from the data in the presentation. -> 1
I really enjoyed today's class. It was very straightforward and answered a lot of my questions about the upcoming assignments. -> 1
For the in class participation, one of the slides said 87 and the answer that was given regarding the Toyota Corolla had a different number. -> 1
I found the in class activity to be confusing during class today, but the issue for it was then resolved so I did not have any other points of confusion after. -> 1
Nothing was confusing today. -> 1
I'm sure a lot of people are saying this, but the in class activity had the wrong numbers compared to when the answers were shown after submission. That created some confusion, but I still knew how to do it, even with the wrong numbers. -> 2

I didn't find anything confusing in today's class. -> 1
I was confused by the in-class activity, because in the first slide, the value was 87 grams/gallon, but in the explanation slide, the value was 8887 grams/gallon. These two values result in totally different answers. -> 3
I was a little confused on the conversion part for the in class activity. I think I was just overthinking but we figured it out as a team. -> 2

The in class participation slides were confusing because they had two different numbers on them. However, you explained how they would be dealt with, and that was helpful.
Nothing was confusing
It was confusing what criteria was required for the in class participation, specifically the format and final answer.
Everything was straight forward about today's class
The PowerPoint slide for the in class assignment had a different number for the CO2 per gallon than the slide shown in class so our group was unsure of which number to use
I really did not find anything confusing today in class! I understood the assignments and everything about climate change.
I was confused about how to calculate the amount of CO2 emissions in grams per mile because the brightspace PowerPoint slides were confusing.
I think a clarification on how to calculate CO2 emissions would be helpful to the class. Other than that the class was executed well.
The most confusing part of today's class was when the data from the bright space slide was different from the data in the presentation.
I really enjoyed today's class. It was very straightforward and answered a lot of my questions about the upcoming assignments.
For the in class participation, one of the slides said 87 and the answer that was given regarding the Toyota Corolla had a different number.
I found the in class activity to be confusing during class today, but the issue for it was then resolved so I did not have any other points of confusion after.
Nothing was confusing today.
I'm sure a lot of people are saying this, but the in class activity had the wrong numbers compared to when the answers were shown after submission. That created some confusion, but I still knew how to do it, even with the wrong numbers.
Not much was covered in todays class. The concept of design tradeoffs was interesting, and clarifying what constraints were included in the solar assignment helped alot
Nothing was confusing at all this class. The largest concern was the exam 1 grades which was resolved.
I was confused on how to do the conversions for the in class participation, and wish we went over it more.
The energy conversion and the slide which cut off the actual grams per gallon by 2 numbers
when assignment 13 is due
I didn't find anything confusing in today's class.
I was confused by the in-class activity, because in the first slide, the value was 87 grams/gallon, but in the explanation slide, the value was 8887 grams/gallon. These two values result in totally different answers.
I was a little confused on the conversion part for the in class activity. I think I was just overthinking but we figured it out as a team.
I thought that everything in class today was pretty straightforward.
I found nothing really confusing in this class. If anything I was slightly confused of where to find natural gas consumed by the indianapolis library.

The in class participation slides were confusing because they had two different numbers on them. However, you explained how they would be dealt with, and that was helpful.
Nothing was confusing
It was confusing what criteria was required for the in class participation, specifically the format and final answer.
Everything was straight forward about today’s class
The PowerPoint slide for the in class assignment had a different number for the CO2 per gallon than the slide shown in class so our group was unsure of which number to use
I really did not find anything confusing today in class! I understood the assignments and everything about climate change.
I was confused about how to calculate the amount of CO2 emissions in grams per mile because the brightspace PowerPoint slides were confusing.
I think a clarification on how to calculate CO2 emissions would be helpful to the class. Other than that the class was executed well.
The most confusing part of today’s class was when the data from the bright space slide was different from the data in the presentation.
I really enjoyed today’s class. It was very straightforward and answered a lot of my questions about the upcoming assignments.
For the in class participation, one of the slides said 87 and the answer that was given regarding the Toyota Corolla had a different number.
I found the in class activity to be confusing during class today, but the issue for it was then resolved so I did not have any other points of confusion after.
Nothing was confusing today.
I’m sure a lot of people are saying this, but the in class activity had the wrong numbers compared to when the answers were shown after submission. That created some confusion, but I still knew how to do it, even with the wrong numbers.
Not much was covered in todays class. The concept of design tradeoffs was interesting, and clarifying what constraints were included in the solar assignment helped alot
Nothing was confusing at all this class. The largest concern was the exam 1 grades which was resolved.
I was confused on how to do the conversions for the in class participation, and wish we went over it more.
The energy conversion and the slide which cut off the actual grams per gallon by 2 numbers
when assignment 13 is due
I didn’t find anything confusing in today’s class.
I was confused by the in-class activity, because in the first slide, the value was 87 grams/gallon, but in the explanation slide, the value was 8887 grams/gallon. These two values result in totally different answers.
I was a little confused on the conversion part for the in class activity. I think I was just overthinking but we figured it out as a team.
I thought that everything in class today was pretty straightforward.
I found nothing really confusing in this class. If anything I was slightly confused of where to find natural gas consumed by the indianapolis library.

That is confusing to me. I found the whiteboard brainstorming in class activity to be a littleconfusing as I wasn’t entirely sure of what to draw and what not to. We needed mor details on the assignment that is due next friday.

9,63,63,Alex,engr131_s014-fall2020,5,Describe what was confusing or needed more details in today's class?,"I didn't find anything confusing during class. I felt that the presentation and class overall moved at consistent and helpful speed and everything was related in a non-confusing manner. -> 1
It was confusing that we were reviewing what types of graphs were correct for a situation when we had already submitted an assignment with our choices of what graphs we thought best displayed data. -> 3
It was confusing that we had done an assignment on what graph we should use for data analysis but we were taught it today in class. -> 2
I was confused by all the due dates and the way the bright space is set up. I forgot to do assignment A06 because it wasn't in the “To Do before class” category for class 4A -> 3
It's a little confusing on knowing which graph or chart to use or if you can use more than one. -> 2
More in depth about how to make more complicated histograms -> 2
Some parts of the in class activity were confusing but it was mainly excel stuff -> 5
The lecture didn't confuse me at all, but when we started assignment A07, I couldn't figure out how to correctly change the bin widths. -> 3
i didn't understand that the histograms didn't need the date so i spent the whole break out room confused. I also think the breakout rooms should've been longer. -> 4
I did not know what value the histogram needed to be edited at. -> 3
Nothing was confusing -> 1
I was confused about how the in class quiz will work and what it is over. -> 1
Nothing needed more explanation in today's class. I found everything to be very clear. However, I would have liked to know what kind of chart should have been submitted for the in class activity. -> 1
Nothing much. I think I just need to get more comfortable using histograms and understanding how to set them up using excel. -> 2
I feel like everything seemed to be pretty straight forward today! I was not confused about anything today! I felt that we really went over histograms well and it seemed to make sense to me! -> 1
Do i have to use a underflow on my histogram or is it just recommended? -> 2
I think sometimes we are unable to follow the slide or the instruction was not clear enough, so I wish professor could go into detail when performing excel stuff -> 3
Nothing -> 1
Initially I was a little confused on how to manipulate certain data within the graphs using the tables but eventually I got it sorted out -> 1
I had issues using excel with my Mac, couldn't find the bins option when making a histogram. I've been having similar problems while doing other assignments. -> 4
I'm just having a lot of trouble with excel, and I'm unable to complete many of the assignments due to this. But I'll figure it out. -> 4
I'm confused on how to find overflow/underflow values. -> 4
I feel as though the theory of histograms was explained well but the implementation of them in excel was a little lacking. -> 3
I was confused for a while because I have a Mac and could not figure out how to change the bin data. I figured out that u can change it by clicking on the value bar itself. It was helpful at the end that professor explained how to add the add on. I wish we were able to reference the slides while in breakout rooms. -> 1
The most confusing part of today's lesson was trying to determine wether to use a line chart or a histogram. -> 2
Nothing! I feel like I understood it all today and it made sense! -> 1
There is not much things that are confusing or unclear. I understand what we are gonna do and prepare for next class, and the definition and use about histogram is clear enough for me -> 1
I believe class today was very informative. There were definitely some question about histograms that I had answered. -> 1
Everything was pretty clear today. The histograms we worked on were pretty self explanatory -> 1
I am still a little confused on when the career exploration modules/quizzes are due compared to the EYM zoom meetings and attendances. -> 1
I found everything pretty straightforward. I wish we saw the slide you were talking about that had al the due dates so we didn't have to find it later, but other than that it was good -> 2
A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful. -> 1
I didn't think anything was confusing even thought I was having computer troubles where I couldn't heard anything though zoom. Other than that the histograms where explained very well. -> 1
I found some of the histogram making to be somewhat confusing mainly because I was on mac and did not know that I needed to add a tool kit to change the bins and basically the characteristics of the entire graph. -> 2
I think that maybe there could be more information on when you use histograms. I know it's for distribution but still a little confused on when you use them all. -> 2
There were parts of the directions for A07 that were unclear, like the part about calculating bin widths and using underflow bins. -> 3
Did the homework assignment need a under flow or over flow bin? -> 1
The in class activity gave my group some confusion because it was not explained in detail, and when breakout rooms opened, we did not understand the entire assignment. -> 3
For the in class activity, it was confusing because nobody in my group had a picture of the slides and we didnt have a way to get to them, so we werent sure on what exactly we needed to do. -> 1
As I also submitted last class, I would like the option of making questions in the class during the presentation. The thing is that the Raise Hand buttton does not show much, as some peers forget it On. I would like another button, such as the tick, to mean I have a question. Thanks. -> 2
Initially, I was confusing about when exactly the A03 was due, but this was cleared up part way through the lecture. I am however still wondering if I need to e-mail the professor if I turned it in 2 minutes late today from the confusion. This seemed to be an issue across the board. -> 4
nothing was confusing except the bins for the histogram -> 2
I felt comfortable today. -> 1
The specific usage of histograms and how to format them correctly what a little confusing. Also how to sign up for the engineering school videos was still confusing. -> 3
I think everything was clear in today's class. I'm starting to get the hang of it which is good so I can get in a routine. -> 1
Everything was pretty simple in today's class. I didn't really have any questions that I could not answer by reviewing the video and the slides. I am still a little confused on the EYM events. -> 1
I had a hard time creating the bins in excel for assignment 7. Everything else was pretty very clear! -> 4
I was a little confused about what graph to use in the in class activity at first. Since a histogram in my mind would also be able to be used -> 2
Everything was clearly explained. The only confusion was with the assignments we were working on. -> 1
What was most confusing in class today was adjusting the bin width by creating an under flow value because I would have to create a large value to make the bin width an integer and I was not sure if I was doing the correctly. -> 3
Not much was confusing. I understood all the concepts but the only real confusing part was figuring out how to navigate excel correctly. -> 2
Could you send out an email or something to help us keep up with assignments? Also are the before class assignments taken as a grade? -> 3
The instructions for the in class assignment wasn't posted in the chat until near the end of the breakout room. This made the assignment difficult to complete. -> 3
I am confused on A05. We were not told how to process that much data on excel. I am not sure about how to complete this team assignment because I dont know how to divide this up and complete the assignment -> 4
how to change the bin size from the assigned bins in excel -> 3
I wish that it was easier to see the questions or prompts when we break off into our individual groups because I had trouble working on the in class activity because I didn't know the prompt -> 1
Great, productive class today. Going a bit slower on the notes would have been nice so I could write the notes. -> 1
There was nothing confusing in the class today for me. I thought everything was explained very well. -> 1
I am still confused on how to identify Underflow Bins. -> 4
I found nothing confusing today, everything made sense to me. -> 1
The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped. -> 3
I still am unsure about the differences between categorical and nominal data. Also, when to use what chart. -> 2
The due dates is still confusing. If they were in a more compiled place, it would be extremely helpful. -> 4
I seemed to understand most the material in today's class. The only thing would be how to keep both ur box width and box number preferences -> 2
The questions we were supposed to answer for the in class activity were not sent so it was difficult to know what were supposed to do in the excel document. -> 4

More in depth about how to make more complicated histograms
i didn't understand that the histograms didn't need the date so i spent the whole break out room confused. I also think the breakout rooms should've been longer.
It's a little confusing on knowing which graph or chart to use or if you can use more than one.
Do i have to use a underflow on my histogram or is it just recommended?
Nothing really was confusing to me today.
The questions we were supposed to answer for the in class activity were not sent so it was difficult to know what were supposed to do in the excel document.
I didn't think anything was confusing even thought I was having computer troubles where I couldn't heard anything though zoom. Other than that the histograms where explained very well.
I think sometimes we are unable to follow the slide or the instruction was not clear enough, so I wish professor could go into detail when performing excel stuff
Everything was pretty clear today. The histograms we worked on were pretty self explanatory
I still am unsure about the differences between categorical and nominal data. Also, when to use what chart.
I seemed to understand most the material in today's class. The only thing would be how to keep both ur box width and box number preferences
Could you send out an email or something to help us keep up with assignments? Also are the before class assignments taken as a grade?
Nothing much. I think I just need to get more comfortable using histograms and understanding how to set them up using excel.
I feel like everything seemed to be pretty straight forward today! I was not confused about anything today! I felt that we really went over histograms well and it seemed to make sense to me!
The specific usage of histograms and how to format them correctly what a little confusing. Also how to sign up for the engineering school videos was still confusing.
I found some of the histogram making to be somewhat confusing mainly because I was on mac and did not know that I needed to add a tool kit to change the bins and basically the characteristics of the entire graph.
Initially I was a little confused on how to manipulate certain data within the graphs using the tables but eventually I got it sorted out
Balancing number of bins and bin width
Nothing needed more explanation in today's class. I found everything to be very clear. However, I would have liked to know what kind of chart should have been submitted for the in class activity.
I'm just having a lot of trouble with excel, and I'm unable to complete many of the assignments due to this. But I'll figure it out.
nothing
Nothing was confusing today. I have a good understanding of using histograms in excel.
What was most confusing in class today was adjusting the bin width by creating an under flow value because I would have to create a large value to make the bin width an integer and I was not sure if I was doing the correctly.
Great, productive class today. Going a bit slower on the notes would have been nice so I could write the notes.
For the in class activity, it was confusing because nobody in my group had a picture of the slides and we didnt have a way to get to them, so we werent sure on what exactly we needed to do.
I think everything was clear in today's class. I'm starting to get the hang of it which is good so I can get in a routine.

The most confusing part of today's lesson was trying to determine wether to use a line chart or a histogram.
The lecture didn't confuse me at all, but when we started assignment A07, I couldn't figure out how to correctly change the bin widths.
Everything was pretty simple in today's class. I didn't really have any questions that I could not answer by reviewing the video and the slides. I am still a little confused on the EYM events.

I found nothing confusing today, everything made sense to me.
I think that maybe there could be more information on when you use histograms. I know it's for distribution but still a little confused on when you use them all.
Did the homework assignment need a under flow or over flow bin?
The instructions for the in class assignment wasn't posted in the chat until near the end of the breakout room. This made the assignment difficult to complete.
I didn't find anything confusing during class. I felt that the presentation and class overall moved at consistent and helpful speed and everything was related in a non-confusing manner.
I wish that it was easier to see the questions or prompts when we break off into our individual groups because I had trouble working on the in class activity because I didn't know the prompt
I was confused about how the in class quiz will work and what it is over.
As I also submitted last class, I would like the option of making questions in the class during the presentation. The thing is that the Raise Hand buttton does not show much, as some peers forget it On. I would like another button, such as the tick, to mean I have a question. Thanks.
Some parts of the in class activity were confusing but it was mainly excel stuff
I did not know what value the histogram needed to be edited at.
nothing was confusing except the bins for the histogram

The due dates is still confusing. If they were in a more compiled place, it would be extremely helpful.
Everything was clearly explained. The only confusion was with the assignments we were working on.
Initially, I was confusing about when exactly the A03 was due, but this was cleared up part way through the lecture. I am however still wondering if I need to e-mail the professor if I turned it in 2 minutes late today from the confusion. This seemed to be an issue across the board.
It was confusing that we had done an assignment on what graph we should use for data analysis but we were taught it today in class.
I feel as though the theory of histograms was explained well but the implementation of them in excel was a little lacking.
I am confused on A05. We were not told how to process that much data on excel. I am not sure about how to complete this team assignment because I dont know how to divide this up and complete the assignment
There were parts of the directions for A07 that were unclear, like the part about calculating bin widths and using underflow bins.
I think everything that was discussed in today's class was clear, and there was nothing really confusing in today's class.
There is not much things that are confusing or unclear. I understand what we are gonna do and prepare for next class, and the definition and use about histogram is clear enough for me","A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful.
Excel is still confusing to use.
how to change the bin size from the assigned bins in excel 
I found everything pretty straightforward. I wish we saw the slide you were talking about that had al the due dates so we didn't have to find it later, but other than that it was good
I am still a little confused on when the career exploration modules/quizzes are due compared to the EYM zoom meetings and attendances.
Nothing was confusing because it was just a rehash of the Brightspace modules.
I believe class today was very informative. There were definitely some question about histograms that I had answered. 
I was confused by all the due dates and the way the bright space is set up. I forgot to do assignment A06 because it wasn't in the “To Do before class” category for class 4A
I had a hard time creating the bins in excel for assignment 7. Everything else was pretty very clear! 
Nothing was confusing
 It was confusing that we were reviewing what types of graphs were correct for a situation when we had already submitted an assignment with our choices of what graphs we thought best displayed data.
 The in class activity gave my group some confusion because it was not explained in detail, and when breakout rooms opened, we did not understand the entire assignment.
 Nothing! I feel like I understood it all today and it made sense! 
 I am still confused on how to identify Underflow Bins. 
 I was confused for a while because I have a Mac and could not figure out how to change the bin data. I figured out that u can change it by clicking on the value bar itself. It was helpful at the end that professor explained how to add the add on. I wish we were able to reference the slides while in breakout rooms.

I was confused about how the in class quiz will work and what it is over. -> 2
Nothing needed more explanation in today’s class. I found everything to be very clear. However, I would have liked to know what kind of chart should have been submitted for the in class activity. -> 1
Nothing much. I think I just need to get more comfortable using histograms and understanding how to set them up using excel. -> 1
I feel like everything seemed to be pretty straight forward today! I was not confused about anything today! I felt that we really went over histograms well and it seemed to make sense to me! -> 1
Do i have to use a underflow on my histogram or is it just recommended? -> 3
I think sometimes we are unable to follow the slide or the instruction was not clear enough, so I wish professor could go into detail when performing excel stuff -> 4
Nothing -> 1
Initially I was a little confused on how to manipulate certain data within the graphs using the tables but eventually I got it sorted out -> 1
I had issues using excel with my Mac, couldn’t find the bins option when making a histogram. I’ve been having similar problems while doing other assignments. -> 2
I’m just having a lot of trouble with excel, and I’m unable to complete many of the assignments due to this. But I’ll figure it out. -> 4
I’m confused on how to find overflow/underflow values. -> 3
I feel as though the theory of histograms was explained well but the implementation of them in excel was a little lacking. -> 3
I was confused for a while because I have a Mac and could not figure out how to change the bin data. I figured out that u can change it by clicking on the value bar itself. It was helpful at the end that professor explained how to add the add on. I wish we were able to reference the slides while in breakout rooms. -> 3
The most confusing part of today’s lesson was trying to determine wether to use a line chart or a histogram. -> 3
Nothing! I feel like I understood it all today and it made sense! -> 1
There is not much things that are confusing or unclear. I understand what we are gonna do and prepare for next class, and the definition and use about histogram is clear enough for me -> 1
I believe class today was very informative. There were definitely some question about histograms that I had answered. -> 1
Everything was pretty clear today. The histograms we worked on were pretty self explanatory -> 1
I am still a little confused on when the career exploration modules/quizzes are due compared to the EYM zoom meetings and attendances. -> 2
I found everything pretty straightforward. I wish we saw the slide you were talking about that had al the due dates so we didn’t have to find it later, but other than that it was good -> 1
A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful. -> 3
I didn’t think anything was confusing even thought I was having computer troubles where I couldn’t heard anything though zoom. Other than that the histograms where explained very well. -> 1
I found some of the histogram making to be somewhat confusing mainly because I was on mac and did not know that I needed to add a tool kit to change the bins and basically the characteristics of the entire graph. -> 4
I think that maybe there could be more information on when you use histograms. I know it’s for distribution but still a little confused on when you use them all. -> 4
There were parts of the directions for A07 that were unclear, like the part about calculating bin widths and using underflow bins. -> 3
Did the homework assignment need a under flow or over flow bin? -> 2
The in class activity gave my group some confusion because it was not explained in detail, and when breakout rooms opened, we did not understand the entire assignment. -> 4
For the in class activity, it was confusing because nobody in my group had a picture of the slides and we didnt have a way to get to them, so we werent sure on what exactly we needed to do. -> 4
As I also submitted last class, I would like the option of making questions in the class during the presentation. The thing is that the Raise Hand buttton does not show much, as some peers forget it On. I would like another button, such as the tick, to mean I have a question. Thanks. -> 2
Initially, I was confusing about when exactly the A03 was due, but this was cleared up part way through the lecture. I am however still wondering if I need to e-mail the professor if I turned it in 2 minutes late today from the confusion. This seemed to be an issue across the board. -> 2
nothing was confusing except the bins for the histogram -> 1
I felt comfortable today. -> 1
The specific usage of histograms and how to format them correctly what a little confusing. Also how to sign up for the engineering school videos was still confusing. -> 3
I think everything was clear in today’s class. I’m starting to get the hang of it which is good so I can get in a routine. -> 1
Everything was pretty simple in today’s class. I didn’t really have any questions that I could not answer by reviewing the video and the slides. I am still a little confused on the EYM events. -> 1
I had a hard time creating the bins in excel for assignment 7. Everything else was pretty very clear! -> 3
I was a little confused about what graph to use in the in class activity at first. Since a histogram in my mind would also be able to be used -> 3
Everything was clearly explained. The only confusion was with the assignments we were working on. -> 1
What was most confusing in class today was adjusting the bin width by creating an under flow value because I would have to create a large value to make the bin width an integer and I was not sure if I was doing the correctly. -> 4
Not much was confusing. I understood all the concepts but the only real confusing part was figuring out how to navigate excel correctly. -> 1
Could you send out an email or something to help us keep up with assignments? Also are the before class assignments taken as a grade? -> 2
The instructions for the in class assignment wasn’t posted in the chat until near the end of the breakout room. This made the assignment difficult to complete. -> 4
I am confused on A05. We were not told how to process that much data on excel. I am not sure about how to complete this team assignment because I dont know how to divide this up and complete the assignment -> 2
how to change the bin size from the assigned bins in excel -> 3
I wish that it was easier to see the questions or prompts when we break off into our individual groups because I had trouble working on the in class activity because I didn’t know the prompt -> 4
Great, productive class today. Going a bit slower on the notes would have been nice so I could write the notes. -> 1

I am still confused on how to identify Underflow Bins. -> 3
I found nothing confusing today, everything made sense to me. -> 1
The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped. -> 4
I still am unsure about the differences between categorical and nominal data. Also, when to use what chart. -> 3
The due dates is still confusing. If they were in a more compiled place, it would be extremely helpful. -> 2
I seemed to understand most the material in today’s class. The only thing would be how to keep both ur box width and box number preferences -> 1
The questions we were supposed to answer for the in class activity were not sent so it was difficult to know what were supposed to do in the excel document. -> 4

 I was confused about how the in class quiz will work and what it is over. 
 As I also submitted last class, I would like the option of making questions in the class during the presentation. The thing is that the Raise Hand buttton does not show much, as some peers forget it On. I would like another button, such as the tick, to mean I have a question. Thanks.
 Some parts of the in class activity were confusing but it was mainly excel stuff
 I did not know what value the histogram needed to be edited at. 
 nothing was confusing except the bins for the histogram
 The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped.
 The due dates is still confusing. If they were in a more compiled place, it would be extremely helpful.
 Everything was clearly explained. The only confusion was with the assignments we were working on.
 Initially, I was confusing about when exactly the A03 was due, but this was cleared up part way through the lecture. I am however still wondering if I need to e-mail the professor if I turned it in 2 minutes late today from the confusion. This seemed to be an issue across the board.
 It was confusing that we had done an assignment on what graph we should use for data analysis but we were taught it today in class.
 I feel as though the theory of histograms was explained well but the implementation of them in excel was a little lacking.
 I am confused on A05. We were not told how to process that much data on excel. I am not sure about how to complete this team assignment because I dont know how to divide this up and complete the assignment 
 There were parts of the directions for A07 that were unclear, like the part about calculating bin widths and using underflow bins. 
 I think everything that was discussed in today’s class was clear, and there was nothing really confusing in today’s class.
 There is not much things that are confusing or unclear. I understand what we are gonna do and prepare for next class, and the definition and use about histogram is clear enough for me","It seems that a majority of the issues that students had with this class had to do with Excel. It seems that they mainly had difficulty with the overflow and/or the underflow bins. Additionally, there were several issues involving the creation of the histograms. There also seems to be confusion regarding assignments and also due dates. It might be useful for the professor to go over any confusion regarding the assignments, and to review the due dates of upcoming assignments.",A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful. The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it wasquick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I wouldhave hoped. I wish we saw the slide you were talking about that had al the due dates so we didn’t have to find it later The underflow and overflow was confusing for the bins.

The pictures of the dam were amazing and it was interesting to use google scholar -> 4
Working on real projects that are also interesting -> 3
I thought learning about hydropower, the Taum Sauk reservoir, and a whole new project was interesting. -> 4
The reservoir -> 2
the hydro powered generators -> 3
I think learning about the reservoir, and doing some research on the history of the resource and about hydropower generators.  I think the introduction of a new project was very infesting. I also found the intro into how to cite and reference your sources to be very informative. -> 3
How hydropower generators worked -> 5
Learning about hydropower was most interesting. -> 2
I thought the way that HEP works was very interesting -> 4
I liked working with my group today -> 5
I found the modeling aspect of the new assignment interesting. I'm excited to learn more about that and figure the project out. -> 5
I found the complexity of hydroelectricity and the application of it in terms of our assignment to be interesting. -> 3
The new project about the dam. -> 3
I liked how we had group discussions I also liked how we got ahead on an assignment due next week and that we were given more time to work on projects so that we aren't cramming many at once. -> 5
I've never had to use APA before this class, so that will be interesting -> 3
I found the discussion about Taum Sauk and how the hydropower generators work! -> 5
I found the new project we are starting very interesting. The fact that it can hold up to 1.5 billion gallons of water is insane. -> 3
A10 about the Taum Sauk Reservoir seems like it will be more intense than the Bike Share assignments. I believe that as a group, we will improve on the new set of assignments -> 4
Knowing about the articles and reliable sources available from the purdue library, that's good information to have. -> 4
The whole concept is very interesting, using data and working with a dam is much more interesting than the bike share project -> 4
I liked all the time we got to work on A10 and I also liked how we were able to ask Neel questions if we were confused. It helped tremendously. -> 5
What I found most interesting is the taum Sauk reservoir and the failure that it had -> 3
hydropower is cool. I really like the Hoover dam. its important to note that despite being a renewable source of power, hydropower has one of the largest environmental impacts -> 2
I found the part about hydroelectric power very interesting. It is more interesting than the bike share project in my opinion. -> 3
I found learning about how hydroelectric dams work to be most interesting. It's nice when you learn a little science on the side. Like a science side salad. With feta cheese. -> 4
I found the hydropower generator interesting. I didn't really know how the generator converted mechanical energy into electric until today. -> 4
I thought that the introduction to the project and the data that came with it was interesting. I also liked the in class discussions of how information could be gathered and what questions to ask. -> 3
The idea that the Taum Sauk Reservoir is basically a free standing dam, but that it failed before and causes problems. However, we did not talk much as a group about the concepts behind it. -> 3
I liked how this upcoming project is more straightforward and more of the engineering I'm used to versus just plain data analysis. There is more formulas and things that I find fun. -> 3
I found the google scholar activity interesting. I enjoy doing research and liked getting the practice finding and citing different articles. -> 2
I found it interesting about the different ways you can find a relatable source. It is helpful to know more that one way to do so -> 2
I found learning about generators was interesting. I hope we get to learn more about how electricity is generated in future projects and assignments. -> 3
It was interesting to learn about the different types of resources we are allowed to use and it was interesting to research the Taum Sauk Reservoir. -> 4
I really like the taum Sauk project we are working on next and I think it will be very interesting because we get to model the system -> 4
I found the explanation of hydroelectric power interesting and I am excited for this next project we are undertaking. -> 4
How to properly cite your sources. -> 3
Seeing the mechanics of how reservoirs work -> 3
The Taum Sauk reservoir is an upper reservoir that failed and had an accident before. -> 2
The most interesting thing was looking into the past history of the Taum Sauk Reservoir. -> 4
I found the introduction of our next project very interesting today. Also, I feel like the time spent in breakout rooms during this lecture was much better than previous calls. -> 4
I found the video about how the reservoir works interesting -> 4
Class today went really well. The class discussion was very helpful, with what the company gave us and what we needed to find. I also believe that the work time at the end is very nice to half to get everything organized for our group to work on the project. -> 5
Hydropower is a very interesting concept that was talked about. -> 3
What I found most interesting in today's class was how the whole process of hydropower works and how it creates power. -> 4
i found that the way that hydroelectric power is used is a very unique way. I knew a little about it, but i'm excited for the project that we're doing to learn more about this. Also, i thought the amount of engineers working on dams was very interesting. -> 4
Today I was able to work with my group and we found out that Microsoft does have a sharing system which we heavily took advantage of. I am very happy with our group work and this will give us even better results. -> 4

 I found interesting about using google scholar and integrating Purdue data base with it. 
 I think learning about the reservoir, and doing some research on the history of the resource and about hydropower generators.  I think the introduction of a new project was very infesting. I also found the intro into how to cite and reference your sources to be very informative.
 I thought learning about hydropower, the Taum Sauk reservoir, and a whole new project was interesting.
 I found the part about hydroelectric power very interesting. It is more interesting than the bike share project in my opinion.
 I found that learning about how power is generated by flowing water through a turbine was interesting.
 The new project about the dam. 
 How to properly cite your sources.
 The introduction to the new assignment 
 i found that the way that hydroelectric power is used is a very unique way. I knew a little about it, but i’m excited for the project that we’re doing to learn more about this. Also, i thought the amount of engineers working on dams was very interesting.
 The most interesting thing was looking into the past history of the Taum Sauk Reservoir. 
 I found the modeling aspect of the new assignment interesting. I’m excited to learn more about that and figure the project out.
 The Taum Sauk reservoir is an upper reservoir that failed and had an accident before.

 A10 about the Taum Sauk Reservoir seems like it will be more intense than the Bike Share assignments. I believe that as a group, we will improve on the new set of assignments 
 It was interesting to learn about the different types of resources we are allowed to use and it was interesting to research the Taum Sauk Reservoir.
 I really like the taum Sauk project we are working on next and I think it will be very interesting because we get to model the system
 Working on real projects that are also interesting
 The pictures of the dam were amazing and it was interesting to use google scholar
 Learning about hydropower was most interesting.
 the hydro powered generators
 I found that learning about the Taum Sauk reservoir was very interesting.
 This class was a little dry, but the introduction to the project helped to clear up some thing that could have been confusing in the future.
 Learning about hydroelectric damns was interesting. This is because its a new and renweable power source with clear tradeoffs
 I found the introduction of our next project very interesting today. Also, I feel like the time spent in breakout rooms during this lecture was much better than previous calls.
 Hydropower is a very interesting concept that was talked about.
 I found that it was important when we talked about information literacy 
 I thought the way that HEP works was very interesting","The students were very interested in hydroelectric power and the reservoirs. Group work and citations were also of interest to the class. The new project seems to interest the students, as well.","I thought learning about the hydroelectric power was interesting  Seeing the mechanics of how reservoirs work  Also, I feel like the time spent in breakout rooms during this lecture was much better than previous calls.

 I found the idea that Excell can process so much data and give relevant graphics out of it interesting today. 
 I found it interesting how to use a histogram 
 I enjoyed working with the in-class activity for today because it helped me understand the creation of graphs in Microsoft Excell.
 I am really enjoying group work and I find it very easy to communicate and engage with my team. We help each other whenever something is confusing and I’m happy that I got grouped with them!
 how histograms could be applied to summarize data sets and their associated distributions.
 Today we got to review histograms and check in with our group members about our project. The new project seems exciting and fun to do
 The in class activity 
 I found that the group time was very helpful because I learned how to make histograms on excel and change the boxes
 histograms. 
 I think the review of graphs was very interesting as it helped clarify the differences between them. I definitely used the wrong graphs for the previous assignments due today, but this class helped clarify the differences. 
 How to create a histogram. 
 I liked learning about finding out how to graph different variables. I also found how the histograms and the use of the statistics function useful. 
 What I found most interesting in today’s class was the implementation of examples to give students a more broad demonstration of histograms. I found it interesting how changing the type of data could completely change whether or not a certain graph was the better choice to use.","Many students found histograms to be the most interesting aspect of the lecture. There was also a considerable amount of interest in Excel, as well as the assignments and statistics. Working in groups seems to also be popular with students.",I think the review of graphs was very interesting as it helped clarify the differences between them. Talking about how to create a histogram in excel because excel can be confusing to work with so this was really helpful. Learning more about my breakout group I was a little confused on assignment 7 so that was a good overview of what to do. I enjoyed analyzing the data for the CoGo bike share users to determine periods of low usage.,"Histograms or Graphs/Charts

Like the previous classes, I love talking to my group and making sure everyone knows what their responsibilities are!!
zscore and how it can be used to find probability and such
We were able to count skittles as a little activity and I feel like that was the most interesting thing this class
I liked the idea of including us into counting the skittles to formulate our data however I didn't see how it connected to the rest of class because we didn't use it at all
I found it interesting to work on assignment 5 with my team and discuss our ideas for recommendations
Learning how to use the z score and putting it in practice
I found finding the probability using the histograms really interesting. It's helpful to know that the x axis in histograms can be changed to percentages to better interpret the data.
How powerful the excel can do.
I found it interesting to see z-scores, which i already knew about as i took ap Statistics during my senior year in high school. I also thought that finding out about the myu and standard deviation was fun to learn about.
What I found most interesting in today's class was the differences between using histograms with less frequencies for the probability and how that differs from using the normalized method or a graph with a higher number of frequencies.","I enjoyed discussing z scores and how they can be used to calculate probability. This is a very useful and practical skill that can be applied in many ways. It is nice to have a class which goes over how to use them and apply them.

Figuring out how to properly work excel is confusing. -> 3
I was confused on how to make a pivot table and then convert it into a graph. -> 3
At this point, the things I have the most issue with are basic technical things. I never did much with Excel or computers in high school, so saving and submitting is challenging occasionally. -> 2
For the most part I understood a lot of the information in todays class, especially with the excel stuff. The only main confusing part was when we were discussing the different versions of average, but I was able to figure out why some of my answers in the poll were wrong during our class discussion. Also for the in person assignment I was confused as to what data we were using for the birthyear outlier activity, but my team helped me figure that out too.

Also for the in person assignment I was confused as to what data we were using for the birthyear outlier activity, but my team helped me figure that out too. Other than that everything else went pretty well. I am excited to learn more during the next class.
I didn’t understand what people were saying about the tech brief assignment. I saw someone in the chat saying the due date was pushed back, however, I didnt receive any announcement of that. 
The details of the in-class assignments. We need more time to view instructions. would be nice if slides were posted before class.
What exactly the perimeters are for in class assignments
Requirements for spreadsheet submission were a little confusing because I wasn't sure if we needed to somehow highlight or notate the outliers.
what was due and what we were suppose to be doing. no supervision or someone to ask
I did not find anything particularly confusing or unclear  this class
I think where to find our assignments, when they are due, what we have to do when is confusing. 
 At this point, the things I have the most issue with are basic technical things. I never did much with Excel or computers in high school, so saving and submitting is challenging occasionally.
 Figuring out how to properly work excel is confusing. 
 The Excel outlier/pivot table part of the class was sort of confusing  however it was cleared up once we did the breakout rooms
 The time for the in class activity is very short. I would like the assignments due dates to be more easily accessible as this information is confusing.
 I did not know how to make a scatter graph with acceptable bounds on excel.
 The thing that I struggled with the most was just navigating Excel. I don’t have a whole lot of experience with it, so it is going to take some practice to get the hang of it.
 The file uploads should be clarified as well as updates to previous assignments.
 Confused about what we needed to display in the excel document for the in class activity.
 I was confused on what was supposed to be submitted to the bright space assignment that was done in class.
 There are many numbers relating to different assignments that sometimes it is hard to keep straight about which ones are due.

 I thought some of the break rooms were a bit short especially the one where we first got assigned to our teams and had the excel project to work on. Everything else moved nicely 
 The in-class activity was slightly confusing as to what the instructions were and what was wanted in the assignment.
 What exactly we are doing when we go into breakout rooms
 I was confused on how to make a pivot table and then convert it into a graph. 
 The bike share project details. There wasn't really much that was mentioned, and the requirements look foreign. 
 The exact dates of assignments and what assignments we should be working on isn’t the most clear during the lectures. 
 I would’ve appreciated if we spent more time discussing the assignments and the expectations that you have for each assignment. For example, Assignment A03 was very overwhelming and I would’ve liked someone to go over the expectations for it.
 I found that making a graph with a pivot table was somewhat confusing","In this lecture, students were most confused about assignment specifics and due-dates, especially the expectations for in-class assignments. Students also struggled working with excel, especially the pivot table activity.

Connecting it to engineering as a whole helped stress the importance of being aware of how your projects may impact the world and others.
 Something interesting in today's class was the carbon footprint website, because it was cool to see the impact I have on the world. 
 I found it interesting how you can estimate your own carbon footprint. 
 Project 3 is really interesting and is reminding me how much I enjoy industrial engineering and mathematical calculations and analyses. 
 The criteria and constraints were very useful to think about what my group needs to consider still.
 I found the website where you can see effects of climate change interesting.
 What I found most interesting was the carbon footprint. I knew about calculating my own carbon footprint but it never occurred to me to calculate something like my cars carbon footprint. 
 global warming website to show the changes over time
 It was interesting to see the different pictures of the arctic, based on the effect climate change has had over the past few decades.
 The interaction was interesting 
 I enjoyed when you showed the nasa site thing that shows the progression of changes in the earth due to environmental impacts 
 Learning about trade offs was pretty interesting in today's lecture. I also like that we are focusing on carbon footprints. Anytime we learn about the environment in any way, I am happy with that respective session
 The most interesting part about today's class was to do the in class activity with the car CO2 emited, is interesting to learn more about our impact to the environment 
 I enjoyed the discussion about climate change and the websites that were shown off. They provide an interesting insight into an issue that needs to be addressed immediately.
 I found learning about the different trade offs interesting.
 I found the whole concept of trade offs interesting because I feel like it is something that we do all the time and we will need to do in the future. No matter what we deal with trade offs in our life.
 CO2 footprint
 I found the analysis of the environmental effect of energy to be very interesting. It was interesting because this shows how impactful something like solar could be for the world
 I liked that we had a lot of studio time to work on our assignments and finish then so that we don't have to spend time outside of class.
 I liked the bit where we calculated the co2 output of all of our cars, that was a fun thing to do and seemed like an important task to be aware of in todays climate crisis.
 I found it very inters to calculated the carbon emission of my car. I would have never thought it was that much. 
 I like the idea of talking about renewable energy's I think they are a very interesting concept that deserves more spotlight 
 I found it most interesting when we were talking about climate change and the huge impact it has had on the earth. I think this topic is very important and I'm glad it was covered in today's class period. 
 It was interesting to see our midterm grades, as well as learn about carbon footprints.
 Calculating how much CO2 our cars burned.
 I found the in class activity very interesting as well as the breakout rooms today! My team and I had a great conversation with our PT, Adam, and we also got a lot of work done for our project. 
 I think it's interesting to learn about climate change and what we can do as engineers to prevent it from getting worse.
 The equation and class activity for car mileage
 Corollas have really good MPGs.
 That our cars generate a los of co2.
 It was interesting to learn about and calculate co2 emissions for a car
 Carbon footprint
 I found it interesting to go over the Code of Conduct from the beginning of the year and work more on the project with my groups.
 The site on carbon footprints.
 Calculating the environmental impact of my car in g CO2 per mile was interesting.
 the idea of trade off
 I enjoyed calculating the carbon footprint of my car. It was also interesting to observe what actions impact our climate.
 CO2 emissions calculator. Also got some good work done on the assignment
 Calculating carbon footprint of our cars
 I found it interesting the different costs we calculated in our assignment 
 Trade off designs were also interesting because they introduced a new idea to us that sounds like a good tool to use.
 calculating carbon emission for cars.
 How much carbon dioxide was emitted from natural gases. 
 finding my carbon footprint
 I found all the information on carbon footprints very interesting. 
 The discussion of design trade offs was very interesting to me. Providing examples as well as the importance of them was a topic that very much appealed to me.
 I found the c02 emissions of our cars and the associated calculations interesting
 I found the striking images shown as an example of the effects of global warming very interesting
 I found the photos that were shown on climate change to be really interesting, they effectively show the large influence of global warming.",Students found today's class extremely intriguing.

We didn't do much just got some work done.
Some of the brainstormed ideas we came up with to prototype our solutions and judge their success.
I thought it was interesting to learn about how to prototype something.
expanding my knowledge on prototypes
designing our prototypes
We could use Fusion 360 officially for our CAD, which I already used.
It was interesting to start making prototypes of our design on here
I found working with my team interesting.
Modeling was the most interesting because I have always enjoyed modeling and look forward to creating prototypes from modeling again.
I like the idea of prototyping, I am very interested in the 3D prininyjng club to help out
I loved the breakout rooms today and our team got a lot of work done, especially narrowing down our six ideas to the top three. Also, we clarified our questions with Jeff Hall, who was extremely helpful!! We are excited to begin the next milestone.
Learning about the benefits of prototyping and how to prototype
The process of creating a prototype and methods of testing were interesting.
Everything :)
I found the wholistic approach of the design project very interesting and am very excited to move forward with it
I enjoyed learning about the ways that you can make informed decisions","The thing that was the most interesting was working with my peers to generate ideas and solutions
Design process
Not a ton was interestinf, but I do think the prototype phase is an important part of this design process and will provide us with beneficial experience for the future
Even a detailed sketch can be a prototype. 
Ways we found that might work to develop our prototype 
I found learning about CAD softwares and 3D printing at Purdue most interesting. 
I found the group time very helpful for assignment 18
it was exciting that i can make something
Something interesting was learning about prototypes and how to make them, including the 3D printing lab that Purdue has. 
Not much, it was mostly just a work day along with clarifications regarding why we build prototypes. 
 I enjoyed the class discussion. I thought it helped me understand what to focus on while prototyping.
 Talking about the different materials we can use to make prototypes. I thought it was interesting that we can use anything from something as simple as cardboard and duct tape to CAD. I also liked Jeff's costume. 
 The most interesting part of todays class was figuring out which of our solutions we will continue to use and make prototypes. Although it was hard to do, deciding on the solutions was still interesting
 Something I found most interesting in today's class was how many clients we have available to use to do prototyping.
 What was due for assignment 17
 The discussion about next steps and designing prototypes
 I found the brainstorming aspect of the class the most interesting because my team was flowing and the ideas were getting somewhere. The talk about prototyping was interesting and got me excited to work on the assignment. 
 The interesting part of class was the use of CAD to prototype.  
 The ways that we will evaluate each prototype.
 I liked brainstorming in breakout rooms with  my group about how to do prototypes.
 I found it interesting how effective CAD modeling can be for starting the prototyping phase, I also found it awesome how many services Purdue has to offer to aid in the prototyping process.
 The act of prototyping is interesting because we can test our ideas.
 It was interesting to learn about the ways to design a prototype.
 Continuing through our next part of the project 17. Learning about engineering reflection guidelines 
 I like the idea of doing prototypes in general, especially how creative you can get while making/testing them. 
 I thought it was interesting when we learned all the softwares we can get for free from itap. 
 I'm enjoying this project as a whole and I'm looking forward to building and testing our prototypes. 
 What I said in the last slide<< prototyping discussion was very informative.
 The fact that we can use surveys in order to obtain reliable prototype feedback.
 It was really nice of robin to take time out of his busy schedule to come and visit our engineering class.
 I found creating the prototypes with my team interesting. 
 I think it was interesting to come up with different ways to test the prototypes.
 What I found most interesting about today's class was all of the different clients that are available to perform virtual prototyping on.

 I think it was interesting to come up with different ways to test the prototypes.
 What I found most interesting about today’s class was all of the different clients that are available to perform virtual prototyping on. 
 I found it interesting how there is so many different ways we can try and represent our model 
 That being said, I liked considering and seeing how we would be able to build our own prototypes and test them as well as possibly implement them into the real world.
 We didn’t do much just got some work done. 
 Some of the brainstormed ideas we came up with to prototype our solutions and judge their success. 
 I thought it was interesting to learn about how to prototype something. 
 expanding my knowledge on prototypes
 designing our prototypes
 We could use Fusion 360 officially for our CAD, which I already used.
 It was interesting to start making prototypes of our design on here
 I found working with my team interesting.
 Modeling was the most interesting because I have always enjoyed modeling and look forward to creating prototypes from modeling again.
 I like the idea of prototyping, I am very interested in the 3D prininyjng club to help out 
 I loved the breakout rooms today and our team got a lot of work done, especially narrowing down our six ideas to the top three. Also, we clarified our questions with Jeff Hall, who was extremely helpful!! We are excited to begin the next milestone. 
 Learning about the benefits of prototyping and how to prototype
 The process of creating a prototype and methods of testing were interesting.
 Everything :)
 I found the wholistic approach of the design project very interesting and am very excited to move forward with it 
 I enjoyed learning about the ways that you can make informed decisions","Most of the students today found the idea of prototyping and modeling very interesting. Many of the students enjoyed brainstorming with their peers in breakout rooms, and other students enjoyed working on and figuring out what to do for their projects and assignments.","The most interesting part of todays class was figuring out which of our solutions we will continue to use and make prototypes. Although it was hard to do, deciding on the solutions was still interesting I found the brainstorming aspect of the class the most interesting because my team was flowing and the ideas were getting somewhere. The talk about prototyping was interesting and got me excited to work on the assignment. I found learning about CAD softwares and 3D printing at Purdue most interesting.

I liked that we were starting to get a bit more into statistics and excel, both are used heavily in chemical engineering
I found the idea that Excell can process so much data and give relevant graphics out of it interesting today.
I found it interesting how to use a histogram
I enjoyed working with the in-class activity for today because it helped me understand the creation of graphs in Microsoft Excell.
I am really enjoying group work and I find it very easy to communicate and engage with my team. We help each other whenever something is confusing and I'm happy that I got grouped with them!
how histograms could be applied to summarize data sets and their associated distributions.
Today we got to review histograms and check in with our group members about our project. The new project seems exciting and fun to do
The in class activity
I found that the group time was very helpful because I learned how to make histograms on excel and change the boxes
histograms.
I think the review of graphs was very interesting as it helped clarify the differences between them. I definitely used the wrong graphs for the previous assignments due today, but this class helped clarify the differences.
How to create a histogram.
I liked learning about finding out how to graph different variables. I also found how the histograms and the use of the statistics function useful.
What I found most interesting in today's class was the implementation of examples to give students a more broad demonstration of histograms. I found it interesting how changing the type of data could completely change whether or not a certain graph was the better choice to use.","I enjoyed the studio time working with my group on our assignments. We got a lot done. 
I really like statistics so I love learning about data distribution and skew and what changes how a group of data presents itself. 
Using excel learning histograms
The part I found most interesting in today's class was how well histograms display the distribution of data. 
The web chart explaining what charts we can use in excel depending on what information we have been given.
It was interesting in today's class to learn about how to create histograms in excel and how to format them properly.
Difference between the graphs 
The histogram calculations were the most interesting.
I liked going over the graphs more
I liked that we got to work with our groups on the infividual assignments
 The usefulness of histograms is great.
 i found the histogram and the A07 interesting to figure out
 The clarification on what type of graph to make for each type of data
 I found interesting the section in which we were shown which chart is best for different data.
 I found the way histograms are able to fit data points into bins interesting.
 I found it interesting to see how many different graphs would work for a set of data
 The flow chart showing which chart to use depending on the type of data being presented. 
 I found it interesting that time can be both continuous or discrete data depending on the context it is used in. For example, in the bike problem, the time is seen as discrete, as bike usage is recorded at certain hours of the day and cannot be determined for any times in between these. 
 The helpfulness of histograms and their ability to display data
 I think the practice with histograms was really important because it cleared up a lot of my confusion and I feel like I understand it much better now.
 I found making histograms to be most interesting. 
 What i found most interesting in todays class was picking the chart types. I found myself struggling with that in the activities so practicing with graph types and data was helpful and interesting to me.
 Histograms and line charts can both be used to show patterns in data where the data are, for example, the total number of bikers during each hour of the day. 
 I found the graph review most interesting. I liked how many graphs would fit a certain scenario, but ones fit better than others, and this was explained in the lecture today. I also thought it was important that the histograms were reviewed. I also thought it was important that the due dates are posted sometime in the class period, either at the beginning or end. 
 I enjoyed analyzing the data for the CoGo bike share users to determine periods of low usage. It was interesting to interpret this data.
 The things that can be shown with a histogram was very interesting. I found it cool that so many things can be gathered with this simple chart.
 Learning about histograms
 I really enjoyed learning about histograms and how to implement them and how they organize data. 
 I enjoyed learning the different ways in which histograms are made. Also the career exploration seems interesting.
 There were many different options for making graphs and changing the formatting.
 The cool histograms were pretty awesome to see. Looking at the different visualizations is nice.
 I found the various uses of histograms to be the most compelling part of today's class. I had never thought about the various ways you could use histograms.
 The histogram plotting and the activity A07
 I thought working thought making histograms was very useful. Online classes can make this type of learning hard through videos but walkthroughs are much more beneficial.
 I found most interesting how to calculate for bins and range. 
 The most interesting thing about class today was learning about how to use histograms, and when the best times to use a histogram are (like what the best data for a histogram is).
 Continued use of Excel has interested me because I never knew just how useful it was with interpreting data.
 I found the assignment 07 was the most interesting because it's helping me understand how to use excel. Excel is tricky for first time users but I'm starting to get the hang of it
 I thought the way to create histograms was most interesting because it's cool to see how data shakes out. 
 I like how the histograms works and implementing them sounds very useful when analyzing data.
 Test
 I found the histogram information interesting as they are a type of table I don't often use.
 Creating histograms and modifying them to make them more useful
 I found how you can draw certain conclusions from histograms interesting. 
 The use of histograms as a potential replacement of a line graph in order to represent some data more effectively 
 Talking about how to create a histogram in excel because excel can be confusing to work with so this was really helpful. I was a little confused on assignment 7 so that was a good overview of what to do.
 How much I was able to get done during the class period, we just kept wasting time and I made progress on 3B
 The most interesting thing Is probably the guide for mac user, which is extremely helpful 
 What I found most interesting from this class was how histograms can be used to analyze data.
 The introduction to histograms and how to use them was pretty interesting. It will be a helpful tool in the future. 
 I found the used of different graphs and what situations were best to uses what graphs interesting. 
 I found it interesting learning how to represent different data with different charts
 Learning more about my breakout group
 The use of excel to create histograms and other charts.
 The most interesting part of class was learning another type of visual representation of data through the histogram. 
 The most interesting thing I got from today's class were the chart type flow charts and getting the general outline of the quiz
 using different graphs for different data sets
 Learning to use various charts in different contexts.
 I enjoyed learning about how to make histograms in excel for the most part, excluding the bit that lacked explanation that I mentioned earlier
 I found the histograms the most interesting today. Earlier in the A03 assignment I was having trouble figuring out how charts worked and making intervals, so learning about bins was really helpful.
 The information about which plots are best used for which questions.

I tend to have a hard time doing the problems by myself, but once the professor goes over them I have a better understanding of the material.
Initially learning the payback formula could have been better with a couple more examples.","The intended structure of team meetings could have been a welcome addition.
Nothing, today went great!
Some of the information regarding economics was confusing. There was a lot of formulas, numbers, equations and other things mentioned in a very short time period.
Everything made sense today in class.
At first, the in class excel activity was somewhat confusing, but as I thought more about the problem, I was able to figure it out.
Nothing was confusing 
The class slides were not posted on Brightspace so it was sometimes difficult to follow along. 
The unit conversions were a bit confusing to keep track of. 
Some of the excel work was mildly confusing but after some things were clarified it became easy.

 I would have loved more clarification regarding altering the M2 algorithm to not include duplicate data for m3
 One thing I found confusing is how to perform M3. Some of the instructions are still confusing in the file.
 I found the instructions for milestone 3 a little confusing.
 It was confusing knowing what was expected for calculating the V naughts and the percent errors for M3.
 Something that was confusing were the directions of M3. I think the professor sped through the instructions. If more detail what the assignment is, would be very helpful.",Most students were confused about the logistics of Milestone 3. Some students were also confused about revisiting milestone 2 algorithms and changing them accordingly for milestone 3. A few students were also confused about the concept quiz and the new data set given.,"The coding part of the project was a little difficult/confusing.

How the process of proving something in mathematics is like examples of how to do something 
Learning about how the non-constructive proof can be used. Especially with the example.
Proofs have no single strategy for solving them and even the best mathematicians get stuck sometimes.
I thought that everything was really cool and unique, but the best was seeing that if you're able to, you can prove by just doing some simple arithmetic if it is just asking for one case.
While it was confusing, it genuinely was interesting to see how different proofs can be used","In this lecture students were interested in learning about different proofs and how they can be used. Students were also interested in the different ways to solve proofs, and thought that errors that occur are also interesting.They also found sets to be interesting.","Seeing the intricate errors that may occur with proof by cases is fascinating to me.

I felt as if the difference between a stack and queue was a little difficult to differentiate. Specifically, why is a stack first in last out whereas a stack is first in first out? What dictates this?
Some of the arays where a bit confusing
In the example with a structure of names, I was confused as to how you would set a limit of names that could be searched for using a lookup function. Would there always be a predetermined amount you could search for considering memory capacities or is there a more efficient method to search for even more names without comprising additional space?
more (concrete) examples of how structure dictates function
I was very interested in the functions examples
I understood everything in class perfectly that structure dictates function","Nothing was confusing today.
No
Nothing was confusing 
One thing I needed more details about was how structured and functions work together.
The prefix trees - the nodes to make a name and how we decide on the letters for each node in the trees 
I thought things were well explained in class.
I found todays class quite easy today. But Data structuring and the tree were nice and easy to follow.
Nothing was confusing good class

How similar the switched on and switched off equations are
The first top hat question
The demonstration
I liked the last question
I liked the demonstrations of the sine functions and comparing it to the spring.
different types of currents in circuits
You can use current to max current as a ratio
I found the last problem we did where we found the energy to be pretty interesting. I thought it was cool that we could just find the energy of a capacitor rather than trying to find current etc.
Comparison of these equations to springs
i liked the oscillation model you used watching the meter oscillate
Circuit variables (electromagnetism) are analogous to spring variables (kinematics)
These circuits seem very similar to the ones we cover in RC circuits
RC circuit example
What I found most interesting was the relation of current to springs and how they oscillate in the same way.
Oscillating circuit. I wonder what application this has in circuits if the current disappears so quickly
I found interesting that an inductor behaves differently in a circuit depending on how long the circuit has been closed.
The live demonstration of a circuit with an inductor
The way inductors work over time
I always find the demonstrations interesting and I think they do a good job correlating with class topics
I found the demonstration showing the visual similarities between springs and the simple harmonic motion of LC circuits
How inductance works at RC circuit
I liked the physical analogy of a circuit to a spring that was demonstrated in class.
Inductance is cool","I liked the demonstration with the graphs. 
Seeing the experiment was insightful and gives a easier way to understand the conceptual topics
The RC circuits
the experiments
Demonstrations!! :)
Different circuits
I thought the circuit demonstration in class was really interesting
the oscillating demonstration with current
circuits

Drawing comparisons between LC circuits and springs 
 the example with the circuit that had the inductor and being able to see the current on the board
 How to solve for 1/2 of max energy.
 How disconnecting a circuit immediately drops current to zero vs a circuit with just resistors and inductors

how splitting the figure into components makes it easier for the integration
I find it interesting that calc is used in physics and how we can see where our math skills come into play, even though it is tricky.
I thought it was interesting to see a similar problem from the video lectures but with the image reversed so I could see what changing certain parts of the problem did to the result.
I thought it was cool how you described that you can take the integral of a rings electric field and it will translate to the electric field of a disc. Integrals are interesting and its cool seeing how they can be manipulated.
The semi-infinite rod problem
I enjoyed working with my zoom group today.
The tool you used to show how the interval changes by moving the point across a line.
The first few top hat questions
I found the process of setting up the integral pretty interesting, considering all of the steps that went into it and the substitutions made.
I think the way to set up the equation for the practice problem is interesting.

 The Top hat question where there were 2 point particles on the x axis and were trying to find the electric field on a 3rd on the y axis. Overall the question felt like a big jump conceptually and I was really lost how we got to conceptually talking about electric Fields to calculations 
 Conceptually figuring out where a point with zero electric field would be on an axis (like the x axis problem we did)
 I thought the questions on calculating the total energy on a point charge was confusing.","In this lecture, students worked on TopHat with charges and electric fields. Students were confused by the two aforementioned concepts, and how to use them to calculate charges and forces.","In the First top hat question, how did Professor Nero determine that one of the components cancelled? When you said Object B had a charge of 1 and we had to determine the charge on Object A I was confused. However, after you clarified that Object A had 4x as many field lines, the answer made sense. I am still confused about why we need to visualize electric fields. I feel like it is redundant because we know the direction of force on a point charge without it. Calculating electric field vs. Electric force was the only confusing part of the lecture The only confusing thing was the signs of the charges.","TopHat/Example problems

 I found the delegation of team roles for assignment 7 interesting. 
 I enjoyed having time to work on my assignments
 In Class Activity
 we started working on the bike project and the idea seemed pretty interesting
 pivot table
 We had time for studio time and I could get help from my teammates!
 nothing much
 Working with my team 
 It was nice to have studio time to work together as a group
 Nothing ",In this lecture students found it interesting to have studio time to work together as a group. Students also found it interesting to work on the in class activity. Students were also interested in pivot tables and creating histograms. They also were interested in completing their assignments and working on the bike project.,I liked how I was able to complete most of assignment 6 I found delegating they team tasks interesting I thought the new project we were working on was interesting to discuss with my team I found the delegation of team roles for assignment 7 interesting. we started working on the bike project and the idea seemed pretty interesting,"Assignment 06/assignment 06

The most confusing part was figuring out the direction of the cross product between two vectors. The right hand rule was a good example of finding that though.
The vector problems that required you to find the direction.
nothing really
The content of the lecture was mostly straight forward. The right hand method was somewhat confusing at first, but as Professor Nero went over the practice problems, the concept gradually became easier to grasp. Otherwise, the explanations of the process of computing the dot and cross product was pretty straightforward. The only things that might need more clarification are the ways to find the sign/direction of the dot product and the purpose and use of the cross product.","the right hand rule and why vector was c was negative 
I feel as if the drawing comparing the 6 different axes regarding the right hand rule could have been more descriptive. It took a little bit for me to be able to grasp the concept. With a clearer image, I definitely would have been able to answer the question with more ease.

How my team discussed the approach to solving a problem, and how we communicated and shared tasks effectively.
I found the different equations used to calculate the needed informationinteresting
In the video we watched during class, we got to see some of the enzymes used in detergents in action. I thought it was very cool to see a real world video of what we are working on.
I enjoy the new format of the classes studio time. It is interesting that we are able to work on the team project at different locations, to more efficiently complete the work.
I thought all of the different approaches my teammates generated to solve one problem was interesting. We all had completely different but viable approaches!","I found it interesting that there is such a step by step process of analyzing enzymes.
I thought the detergent enzyme video was interesting.
i liked that we started work on the project
I thought it was interesting to learn about how plots can be used for valid analysis of data.
I found the assignments being due at the end of next class pretty interesting since this never happens.
Starting to do projects with team is a great thing and is also very interesting   
I was very interested in the overall problem that was given to us, especially involving enzymes.  
I liked using a real world problem and doing calculations based on physical things rather than just getting numbers in a mat lab file.
Today, I thought that the in class activity for the project was very interesting because I think that the enzyme graphing is very entertaining and interesting !
I thought it was very interesting that we finally get to work with our team on the final project. Anylyzing enzymes is fun to me becuase it is something that I enjoy learning about and working with.

I was confused about using sub functions in main functions, but gradually I got it and was able to do the work.
Why there were no variables in the workspace when the main function was used to call other sub functions to perform the necessary calculations.
I wish we would have done a couple of more practice questions in preparation for our quiz
Nothing was really confusing in class today. But if I had to choose something it would be why the main function doesn't have any inputs and only an output. I didnt really understand if you needed a specific number of subfunctions for the main function.
I would like to hear more about the quiz since it is the very first time we are taking it. I would also appreciate a more detailed explanation of UDFs.
Just the idea of different ways you can implement a sub function inside a main function.
I was confused about the difference between user defined functions and regular functions at first.
I needed more details on how you can call sub functions using the main function

i was confused by how to figure out the function to make an array of all one number
I was confused over opening and the deign of A05, after further instruction and help from the ta, I figured it out.
I was confused about finding certain digits in arrays.
For the in class activity some of the solutions appeared to be fixable by multiple methods
I felt confused about how to upload my scripts to Brightspace for future Matlab assignments. It would be helpful to do more of an overview as a class.
A few more details and examples of the debugging and array indexing would have cleared up a few minor questions, but overall pretty clear.
I was confused about the types of errors. I was also having troubles with replacing and copying arrays at the first time, but I figured out what I got wrong larer and got through it.
The difference between the syntax errors. It can also sometimes be difficult to solve dynamic semantic errors.
the way we replace the array with a new array was difficult to grasp
This class was clear and not at all confusing.
I was confused on how the parameter for a matrix counts from top to bottom through the columns rather than the rows but the diagram in the presentation helped me a lot.
The block comments were confusing because details on when and where were not given.
The whole idea of scripts in matlab . Traversing through arrays in order to exact elements.
Using the sum function was a little confusing at first.","The last two sections of the slides felt a little rushed & I would have preferred to have a little more time spent on them.

 Using built in functions for SSE
 I was very interested in how MATLAB calculates all of the linear regression values versus excel, since they both get the same values but in different ways. 
 I found it interesting that we can calculate the r squared value of a function exactly like excel does it.
 I thought it was interesting how excel can be used for statistics. It seems very useful for dealing with data. 
 Today was a good class. It was nice having a refresher on excel 
 The most interesting was that we used excel which I like and I can find it interesting to use.
 I was intrigued by the idea that error can be quantifiable in any linear set of data.
 I was very interested in the fact that you could use a best fit model line using least squares regression and also that the r^2 is equal to 1-SSE/SST. Also that you can use SSE, SST, r^2 to calculate any model line. I also learned that SSE is sensitive to outliers and skews.
 That the area of squares is used in order to determine how good of a fit something is","In this lecture, students found finding the SSE and SST values to be interesting. Students also found it interesting how linear regression can be used on a data set. Students also found making graphs interesting.Students found it interesting to use both excel and matlab. They also found it interesting to learn how to calculate r squared values.","I thought it was interesting that you can calculate the sse sst and r squared values all by hand. When we figured it out we then compared it to the actual computer found values. Mine were quite accurate I found finding the SSE and SST values to be interesting because this is correlated with the r squared value which is normally calculated by excel, but we were able to calculate it. I found it interesting how linear regression can be used on a data set and the fact that about 6 different values was pulled just from the line of best fit equation was cool. I found the SSE and SST calculations very interesting. I also found the slides to be very helpful and the activity helped solidify the subject. I found making graphs fun and interesting. Trend lines and r^2 values are aesthetically pleasing to me.","matlab/MatLab/MATLAB/Matlab

I also light the laser related examples because they were pretty. I also like the example of manipulating the light that could pass through the panes on the projector.
 I enjoyed learning about the behavior of light with respect to the denser material and the attraction to the normal.
 I think placing in order questions from largest to lowest is interesting.
 Comparing index fractions to each other
 I thought the polarizers were cool because you could add a diagonal one which changed it to allow light through.
 the demonstrations and concepts ","There seems to be no confsuion related to the material covered in class. Students really enjoyed the in-class demonstrations as it helped them further deepen their understanding of concepts in light, refraction, and reflection.",I thought the in class demonstration with the polarizers was very interesting. I really liked the light demonstration where you shined a light through a glass tube and then put it through water. It was cool seeing the light change. I found the example with the laser and the refraction to be interesting. I liked the last demonstration with the light filters. Probably my favorite demonstration of the year.

The different plots that we need to submit to m3 in different parts of the milestone we're not well explained -> 3
I think the usage of functions to solve values of V0 and Km was a bit confusing -> 3
The instructions for M3 were very confusing and could have been more clear about when the reference values were used and when the calculated values were used. -> 3
I thought that a lot of the instructions were unclear for M3. Part 0 asks for strengths and limitations of our algorithm, and then asks us how we will utilize the feedback we received to change our algorithm. However, we did not get any feedback on our algorithm, and we did not lose any points on our algorithm. Also, we were addressed by a TA that said that we needed to use the given V0 values for the new enzyme to calculate Vmax and Km, not our algorithm calculated V0 values. This is not inherently obvious, and is a very important distinction to make. The instructions need to be clearer. -> 4
The milestone 3 was confusing because our team was struggling whether to compare enzymes from milestone 2 with the PG0-X50 or if we should apply our method from M2 to calculate the v naught values of PG0-X50. -> 3

I can use more work on figuring out how to change the order of the matrix using the for loops.
Explaining more the looping without looping, please. 
Even with the example in class I still am confused on question 1 for A11.
I found learning to index across rows and columns in different ways confusing.
Nothing
Nothing was very confusing
 I was confused by the last question on the ICA. Particularly, how I should stop and set of for loops from running in the middle of the matrix. 

 Nothing
 Nothing was confusing in todays class.
 Most confusing is still complex loops
 Nothing was confusing, all of it makes sense since most of it built upon what I learnt. 
 The order of going through a matrix with for loops.
 CS159
 indexing within multiple for loops
 I would like more explanation on when to use which specific functions for complex loops or when to know how to do multiple loops inside each other.
 More practice or examples on harder indexing for the matrix would be appreciated, as the examples are too easy.

 Initializing for loops backwards 
 Nothing was confusing today. All my issues were cleared up.
 Using nested for loops to move across the elements of a a matrix 
 Modifying for loops to stop or change directions was a little confusing. The use of x:-1:y was a little unexpected but made sense once I was able to use it in Matlab 
 Changing rows and columns inside a loop
 I found it confusing on how you decide what value you need to increase rows and columns on.
 I think it would be more helpful if the in class example of nested for loops outputted a matrix, like what has to be done for A11, rather than outputting a linear array.
 The different ways to move through a matrix using a complex loop is still a little confusing to me. It took aw while to figure out how to do the in class activity. 
 The way that we switched the direction of the for loops was a little bit confusing. I never knew we could increment values by -1 using the colon.
