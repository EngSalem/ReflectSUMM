"I am still a bit confused about why the voltage was negative in the first given example even though the voltage coming out of the battery is positive.
Problem 27.54 with the car motor problem was confusing. I did not understand what the starting motor does. Does it withdraw or add voltage? Does it act as a resistor or a battery? Otherwise your lectures were clear and concise as always.
The idea of grounding was confusing for me. I feel like seeing some more examples would be helpful.
some of the ideas about grounding were confusing, especially with the top hat, but i think i have the general  idea that a grounded circuit has a voltage drop of 0.
I found grounding to be very confusing; what does it mean for a circuit to be grounded?","The idea of grounding was confusing for me. I feel like seeing some more examples would be helpful.

"I found the centripetal force problems to be very interesting. I usually enjoy relating centripetal force to conceptual ideas, so I enjoyed that part of the lecture.
I thought the question of whether throwing something was faster than terminal velocity was interesting
I found it interesting for the terminal velocity and the acceleration is zero
The terminal velocity question was also kinda cool because it explained why you can't just jump into water safely at large heights.
The fact that there can be acceleration when velocity is is constant fascinates me.","I found the centripetal force problems to be very interesting. I usually enjoy relating centripetal force to conceptual ideas, so I enjoyed thatpart of the lecture.
 The terminal velocity question was also kinda cool because it explained why you can't just jump into water safely at large heights. 
The most interesting thing in today's lecture was calculating the acceleration a person feels when they hit the water from jumping from an airplane.  It showed that the body cannot stand such a massive increasein acceleration .
 The first few top hat problems about the steel ball vs the ping pong ball. Interesting real life examples.
I found the explanation of drag force most interesting because it is a topic O have never covered before."

"The top hat question about relative motion
1D motion, specifically question 4 from the concept quiz that we took yesterday
Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
Relative motion was slightly confusing but not after explanation
For the rifle and the car example: why the bullet would land on top of the car again.","Probably the most confusing thing was when to use addition vs subtraction in relative motion. I can understand why each works, it just takes a bit of getting used to.
The monkey hunting problem. I felt that this part of the lecture was covered too fast. Specifically, I was a little confused about the relation between the two Delta Y equations (the monkey and bullet). I didn't understand this setup fully.
 the problem where we had to derive an equation with the shooting of the monkey as it was in free fall made absolutely no sense. I still dont really get it.
 need more clarification with the vector relative motion. more example problems 
I need to work on using the correct kinematics equation. The concept of relative motion is confusing, because I can't understand reference views."
"Just a quick review of when to use sin vs cos in vector math and which angles to apply, depending on which function is chosen (just because they are, technically, interchangeable)
How to stack the vectors from head to tail. When is it allowed, and when is it not?
I was confused about angle conversions in this lecture. I understand that you add based off of what quadrant the vector is in, but on an in-class example that rule didn't work, and I needed to subtract 360Â°.
Overall, the lecture was efficient and assessed everything that was taught throughout the online lecture videos. However, going a little slower throughout the problems to let students understand and catch up through every step will allow for more information absorption. Also, during the top hat questions, it could've been more informative to go over why the incorrect answers were actually wrong.
I was initially confused on how subtracting vectors worked but I figured it out","How the direction of a resultant vector compares to the value. I have trouble understanding their relationship.
How the right-hand rule can be manipulated to apply to the cross product and how unit vectors create a direction.
Something that was confusing about today's video lecture was how in some cases with inverse tangent, you must add 180 degrees to your answer. I understand that this can be seen with the graph of tangent, but I'm not sure how you know when you should trust your answer or know that u have to add 180 degrees.
Using Top Hat/getting used to using Top Hat was a bit confusing and tough. I wasn't always sure when to submit answers, how much time I had, and I had some trouble getting out of the zoom window quickly and to the Top Hat one. I think the more practice I get with it though the better I'll get at it.

More in depth about how to make more complicated histograms
I had issues using excel with my Mac, couldn't find the bins option when making a histogram. I've been having similar problems while doing other assignments.","A clearer description for overflow/underflow bins in excel would have been useful.
The explanation of the way to format histograms was confusing as it was quick but didn't go over the more difficult stuff as well as I would have hoped.
I wish we saw the slide you were talking about that had al the due dates so we didn't have to find it later
The underflow and overflow was confusing for the bins.
The instructions for the in class assignment wasn't posted in the chat until near the end of the breakout room. This made the assignment difficult to complete."

"z-scores can help to find probability of certain events.
I enjoyed discussing z scores and how they can be used to calculate probability. This is a very useful and practical skill that can be applied in many ways. It is nice to have a class which goes over how to use them and apply them.

The in-class activity was slightly confusing as to what the instructions were and what was wanted in the assignment.
The thing that I struggled with the most was just navigating Excel. I don't have a whole lot of experience with it, so it is going to take some practice to get the hang of it.

"I found that it was interesting how to use breakpoints within your code.
The usage of script vs functions and how you can call a function multiple with different output variables names.

The use of user define function to repeat a set of calculations.
I found it interesting that a function can be used to loop a single formula with multiple variables.

In class I was still confused about how to address the clients and people involved in an issue in the problem statement. I also got confused with criteria vs constraints.
One thing that was confusing was the work we should be doing in class. I felt like there were too many places to get information. We seemed to skip to AO5 and then go back to class 2B and then go back to AO5. It would be great if everything was streamlined under one class.

I found everything discussed in class today to be clear. The pacing was not too fast and the detail for upcoming assignments was understandable.
Today's class was clear and doesn't need more details currently, but Excel has been problematic with saving and saying I need to sign in while I am already signed in.
The most confusing part was just the required EGO meetings and how to access them along with minimum requirements.
Some more tips for creating chart titles could be useful.","I think that what our expectations for work in our groups should be more clearly laid out I was not entirely sure how to approach working when we only had individual assignments.
One thing that could've used more details would be how to determine what type of chart to use.
I liked that we went over problem statements more. I think it would've been helpful if we would've been presented with a client memo and then had to come up with a problem statement for that memo as a class. I think more in class examples similar to our assignments would be phenomenal.
Describing the engineering specific sessions and how they worked was very confusing and not thouroughly explained, however I am assuming that it will be explained in detail more in the future
This isn't directly related to today's lecture, but I'm still confused on the different data types and determining the data types of different data. I would appreciate if we reviewed this concept further."
