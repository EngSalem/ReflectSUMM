the differential equation portion involving RC circuits was a little confusing. Another example would be very much helpful for a lot of us I think.
I was a bit confused with the loop rule and multi loop circuits. I had trouble on the concept quiz so I think seeing some more examples being solved would help me.
I was confused about how to use a calculator to solve matrices.
I find the orientation of magnetic fields very confusing. I'm not sure how to tell if it should be pointing in or out of the page, why it is always in the positive or negative k direction, or how it affects which direction a particle will circle in."
"The planar electric field being constant
The return of the shell theorem to explain a more complicated concept
the different types of symmetry
I found it interesting that when we use symmetry for an infinite plane, the electric field is a constant.

Today's lecture was very interesting. It showed how Gaussian symmetry in different shapes were similar.
I think it's interesting how the shell theorem can be used in physics
I found it neat and helpful that drawing a Gaussian surface around or through certain objects with uniform surface charge makes finding E on the object much easier. However knowing how to orient the Gaussian surface seems a bit difficult in some situations.
I thought this concept was easy to grasp. The videos did a great job of helping me picture the scenarios."
"The equation for magnetic fields on point chargesThe equation for magnetic fields on point charges

I found the magnetic field lines interesting because no matter how small they get they will always have a north and a south end.
I found the balloon tophat question most interesting about today's class because I thought too hard about it at first and once it was explained it was an “ah” moment
I really enjoyed writing the circuit equations in terms of one another and then forming differential equations. On top of already enjoying this unit, I really like this kind of math as well
I really like that magnetic field lines follow the same rules as electric field lines. I also like that magnetic monopoles haven't been discovered!"
"The multiple ways/ equations possible to find the same answer.
Velocity and acceleration and their graphs
Seeing the right hand rule explained live was very helpful and I liked the toy car demo.
I found the explanation of the average velocity and acceleration to be most intresting
Top hat","The right-hand rule was very interesting for me because it is something I've never seen in action before. I was a little confused about it during the reading, but what was talked about in class helped me to get the hang of what it's all about.
I really liked the description of the graphs between acceleration, velocity, and displacement. I've had trouble with them in the past but I feel like I have a good understanding now. 
 I found the live demonstration interesting. It is always useful to see physics happening in real life. It makes all the work seem real and obtainable. We can forget that all this math has real applications.
I really enjoyed the top hat question with the negative cosine angle, causing the dot product to be negative even though it was scalar. I go the question incorrect but I liked how it was explained and Ilearned a lot from it.
I thought the explanations of dot and cross products were interesting because they helped me understand the concepts better."
"The most interesting thing in today's lecture was how the position, velocity, and acceleration graphs relate to each other.
Break out rooms were fun and enjoyable
I like projectile motion from my high school physics class so when this video lecture began to talk about gravity and free fall, I really enjoyed it.
I found the conceptual questions that go along with free fall interesting. I like the concept of gravity being constant acceleration.
The dinosaurs (Jurassic park vibes), and the intro to group was interesting, because it gave me an idea of how things will work in the future for quizzes and tophat questions.","The dinosaur problem was most interesting. I enjoyed that it really challenged you to think about how to set the equations equal to each other and which equation to pick.
I like projectile motion from my high school physics class so when this video lecture began to talk about gravity and free fall, I really enjoyed it. 
I enjoyed the conceptual top hat questions during this lecture. These connections brought a true understanding of how kinematics work in real life (neglecting air resistance of course).
understanding and getting the majority of the problems asked in tophat correct. this means that i have some sort of a grasp and understand of the topic we're on. 
 found the breakout rooms to be the most interesting. Working as a team is always more productive as I was able to hear different approaches to solving the problem."

I felt like the exam was overall pretty good. This first part was a little more confusing than the second for me, although my group mateshad trouble with the second. 
Questions were very hard compared to study guide. Studied concepts but could not figure out problems.
thought question 2 was confusing because I wasn't sure what to do with the acceleration exactly because block 2 was heavier than block 1.
I guess the test, not sure if my group got it right. Otherwise great experience 7/10 would try again."
"I liked the top hat questions. I feel they are engaging and make it easier to learn material.

"the information about cold vs. hot welds.
Learning about the relationship between normal force and friction and how friction works and looks molecularly.
I found that learning how to set up the system and what masses are included is important to solving friction problems
I thought it was interesting that friction is a property that goes down to the subatomic level.
The first top hat problem with the 3 blocks and the problem with the sled being pushed and pulled. I was quite fascinated with the answers for both of these.","I thought learning about the coefficient of friction and how it's proportional to the normal force was interesting. 
 I found the description of static friction most interesting. I thinkstatic friction is more interesting than kinetic friction because whenstatic friction reaches it's maximum value, any amount of force appliedwill accelerate the object.

I found learning about how friction was really interesting. It was coolto understand how the cold welds between two surfaces impacted friction."
"The right-hand rule and how to use coordinate plane with just x and z values (as opposed to x and y).
I found everything to be fairly straightforward during today's lecture. Graphs of derivatives confused me a bit, so maybe more time could be spent on that.
I was quite confused with the x,y,a, axis top hat question. I didnt quite understand the placement of the z axis (axis coming out/into the screen).
Everything was clear during this lecture. I had no confusion and I understood everything from the clicker questions.
i was still a little confused about the position velocity and acceleration graphs. i always get confused when interpreting them. i'll definitely go watch some youtube videos about it but it would go a little more in depth","The right hand rule because I was just a bit confused how to read it or tell when it's pointing in or out of the screen.

How to determine if the answer to the cross product or dot product is positive or negative.
 the only thing that I would want more details in would be the way an object is 3-D on paper because i still do not get that

Circular force was a bit confusing when dealing with acceleration.
The most confusing part of the lecture was determining the centripetal force.
I was confused on the units for drag force
I need more clarification about why the acceleration vector points in toward the center.","What was confusing about this lecture was what forces can be considered a centripetal force.  I saw that soletimes it can be the normal force or some other force.
 I think it was tough to conceptualize some of the drag force problems. Although it's not going to be a heavy focus for the exam, I would've liked to connect more drag force problems to conceptual ideas.
 circular motion was barely even taught, especially the net force portion 
the lesson moved really fast for such a complicated topic. deriving the equations was confusing and there weren't enough examples or applications to understand the formulas
I was a little confused by the application of acceleration at an instant when terminal velocity changes. However, your explanation cleared itup. The application of multiple g's tripped me up and I got the practice problem incorrect as I forgot a g."
"The implications of carbon energy and the need to switch to new types of energy could have been covered more.
Still confused on what needs to go into the spreadsheet for A13
The most confusing part of today's class was attempting to provide evidence for why the tool/website I chose for unit conversions is reliable.  There is not a clear way to show that the tool is useful and trustworthy.
I think the participation work was very vague
I was not confused about anything","I would like more details about the A13 to be more clear so it's easier to accomplish.
The in-person activity wasn't clear on what needed to be done.
unfortunately we received our grade back for assignment A12 and we were somewhat co fused on how we did not get a higher grade.

"I found the video very interesting because it stressed how important it is for engineers to do many trials on products before releasing them.
The talk and examples about having a diverse engineering team was interesting and the video example was a good example of a product which did not have a large and diverse data set during development.
What we learned in Excel was really cool when we could figure out what to do.
I found learning how to create graphs to be the most interesting part, and I think the most exciting part was meeting my team.
pivot tables and my new team","The youtube video was interesting regarding why diversity is useful when creating new products
I think the Excel stuff is pretty interesting.
 I found it very interesting that all of my group members are on campus. We can all meet in person and don't have to worry about different time zones.

"Excel stuff was confusing and the problem statement
Excel practice at the end was confusing because we didn't have much time
Some of the instructions for the in class activities were a little unclear.
I was a little confused today when we where downloading the file from online and making it available to use on excel.  I think we could have slowed down there a little bit to make sure all of the students are on the same page and are able to open up the spreadsheet without any errors.
I found it confusing when I tried to download the data sheet to excel. I also was kicked from the zoom call and had trouble getting back in to the call.","I was confused about entering the complex calculations into excel. I haven't used excel in a long time so I think I just need practice. 
 The problem statement outline was not very helpful and the problem we were asked to find seem very vague.

 The only thing I found confusing today was the formula input for the gravitational forces calculation"
"Pivot tables were sort of rushed through and their uses weren't fully explained which left my breakout group confused on what to do.
The amount of time spent during class explaining the different data types could use some lengthening.
Maybe more about the team project? And the bike project too.
I was confused about the in-class assignment and what needed to be submitted on the excel document.
I think what we were supposed to do with the excel document was a little bit confusing.  The directions weren't super specific and I thank the assignment should have been clarified a little better.","If you could put the slides on brightspace before the video call itwould be helpful, because then we could have it open and look at them ifwe get lost during a call
I was confused on what the task is for assignment 5 and how we need to use the bike share data to complete the assignment.

We have talked about the quiz and test, everything is clear.
Nothing was confusing
the flow rate chart was confusing
I did not find anything confusing in today's class.","I found that during the studio time, I was confused as to whether use a constant pressure head or using a changing one that changes based on the height of the upper reservoir.

The details for the next assignment
I found nothing to be confusing or unclear in today's class. Everything was explained well and made clear prior to the given work time. Making sure to explain what was needed and expected for the project helped me gain a better understanding before going into it.
A13 assignment needs clarification
Requirements for A13 are very confusing. Do we need to even use natural gas data/will the library still be heated by natural gas while powered by solar panels? Should we assume that solar panels have 0 carbon emissions, or do we need to take into account the carbon emissions caused by the manufacturing process of those panels?","I feel like today's class could've used a more in depth explanation of how power is produced, we discussed methods of producing power but not actually how the power was produced.
 I was confused on A13 even after reading the instruction on part 4, it included calculations that I didn't understand where we could get the information from.
 thought it was confusing when we were trying to figure out what exact calculations we needed to do to do an environmental and economic evaluation 
There's no excel file and the memo is rough with info.

The assignments are very vague. The individual assignments are pretty straightforward but the team ones are super confusing sometimes.
Nothing was confusing today, we had a lot of good work time during class
I am still slightly confused on the purpose of finding the overall slope of the data. I know this can help find trends but am confused how this will help with scattered data. Overall, I get the process of it but found the purpose of it confusing.
The overall approach to the reservoir's laminar approach was confusing, especially with the example of the graph and trendline. It was a bit vague.","Simple linear regression needed more details, especially as it relates to what the r squared value does.
Assignment 11 needed more explanation. Specifically, I struggled with the wording of particular questions. If the problems were more descriptive I would have understood the questions much easier.

How we should develop a testing protocol is unclear. I don't remember going over it in the video modules and it isn't explained in the technical brief or assignment 17 instructions. I think going through an example of a testing protocol for the smart recycling bins would have been beneficial to the teams' understanding of what a testing protocol is and how to develop an effective one. 
The team was confused on what CAD software to use and some of the other elements of the assignment.

One thing that was a little confusing was the typing of certain symbols and formulas into Excel. For example, it was difficult for me to remember how to lock certain numbers as absolute values. Once I refreshed my memory I was able to get it because I did have experience with it while watching the pre-class videos, but it was a lot for me to remember. Also, I never figured out how to type the symbol for degrees with my keyboard into Excel. It was not a big deal, but I am guessing that learning that information will save me some time and energy in the future.

I was confused that there is a way to do a for loop and a while loop in a nested structure. It was hard to learn how to use these as a vector.
The most confusing thing was the first problem of A11. I was confused on how the no loop would work efficiently
What was confusing was the difference between suppressed and unsuppressed code because this made the in class activity very difficult to get started."
"i found the hair measuring and spy satellite applications to be immensely interesting
