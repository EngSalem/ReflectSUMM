Friction on an incline was what confused me. When more than one or two forces are applied, I feel like things are bound to get confusing.
The last example with two blocks and one sliding on the other was confusing
I thought the last top hat question with the two masses was confusing. This is because I didn't understand how we could combine the two masses into one system when force was only being applied to the top mass.
Two top hat problems: the pirate and the last one with the 2 blocks stacked. I thought we went through the pirate one a little too fast, and for the last one, we ran out of time because class was ending.","I found the top hat question about the two blocks hanging from the pulley the most confusing just because I understood it when I set the tensions equal to each other but not conceptually 
 I feel that the last question was pretty confusing during today'slecture. I believe that we should of spent more time talking through that question instead of rushing at the end of class and briefly going over it.
I would like to see more example problems being done of static friction. More specifically how to use the static friction coefficient and how todevelop and form the equations needed to solve each problem because I am still struggling with that concept of physics. 
The problems were pretty difficult in terms of understanding the fbds and what is happening to the system and i wish there was more time given overall even for the conceptual questions

"How to download and use the p code for today's in class activity was a little confusing
The part of gradescope which ask us to upload the PNG image

At first, how to access the assignments in the MatLab drive was a little confusing, but now I fully understand.
At first, trying to open the Matlab p file to work on the problems was confusing. However, once the TA went over the correct command to use it made more sense.
It would have been helpful if the gradescope submission method was explained in more detail.

I was slightly confused on the differences between the the two errors described. I had trouble telling which error was which.
Today, the lecture was not very confusing, but I think something that could use a better explanation could be identifying the different errors in the code. That, along with learning more convenient methods to insert and change arrays, would allow me to code a lot quicker.

"The idea of an ontology was most confusing.
I found what exactly constitutes folksonomy to be a bit confusing. For example, I know that tags are inherent to the definition as well as a lack of hierarchy, but if we take the hashtag example from class, is there not a sense of hierarchy in terms of preference of the user for the tag. Is there not a hierarchy between the user and the folksonomy or perhaps the interface which presents the info to the user( though perhaps that falls more into the M.L. Realm).
One thing that was confusing was the difference between categorization types.

"A more detailed explanation of when and where the assignments are assigned and submitted. I noticed on Brightspace that there were resources for the assignments, but found it difficult to distinguish how it would be submitted.
The lecture was good, It contained a lot of information about the course structure, and how the semester will go. I would've liked a little more information about the structure of the group projects but I'm assuming that will come when we start them.
